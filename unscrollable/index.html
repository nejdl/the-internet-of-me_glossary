            <span class=invisible>It has led to</span> errors and lower quality
            <span class=invisible>of care. An overloaded nurse or </span>physician becomes
            <span class=invisible>an overwhelmed one, who receives</span> too much information
            <span class=invisible>at once and cannot focus on a patients care tasks.</span> The risks
            <span class=invisible>on the patient are too high; bad outcomes are</span> just behind the corner.

        <h1>PEOPLE DON'T REALLY READ ON THE INTERNET</h1>


<p id="drei">Today’s internet is bland. Everything looks the same: generic fonts, 
    no layouts to speak of, interchangeable pages, and an absence of expressive 
    visual language. Even micro-typography is a mess.
    Web design today seems to be driven by technical and ideological constraints 
    rather than creativity and ideas. Every page consists of containers in containers 
    in containers; sometimes text, sometimes images. Nothing is truly designed, it’s 
    simply assumed.
    Ironically, today’s web technologies have enormous design capabilities. We have 
    the capability to implement almost every conceivable idea and layout. We can 
    create radical, surprising, and evocative websites. We can combine experimental 
    typography with generative images and interactive experiences.
    And yet, even websites for designers are based on containers in containers in 
    containers. The most popular portals for creatives on the web — Dribbble and 
    Behance — are so fundamentally boring they’re basically interchangeable.
    How did this happen?
    There are a few reasons. Technological frameworks like Content Management 
    Systems (CMS) and blogging platforms like WordPress are based on templates. 
    Web pages on these frameworks are not individually crafted but generated on the 
    fly by piecing together various media types like images, headlines, body text, 
    and videos. Templates are not designs. Rather, they are rules for combining 
    related data types. Beyond the template, these platforms typically offer users 
    no way to influence a page’s visual appearance. What you see is what you poured 
    into the template.
    In other words, templates are content agnostic. And that is the problem.
    One of the fundamental principles of design is a deep and meaningful connection 
    between form and content; form should both reflect and shape content. Separating 
    them breaks this principle and creates generic content containers. In a design 
    sense, templates are meaningless; the form adds nothing to the content.</p>
