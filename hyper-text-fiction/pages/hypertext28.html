</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As “<span lang="es">Filipinas dentro de Cien
Años</span>”, this article was originally published
serially in the Filipino fortnightly review “<span lang="es">La
Solidaridad</span>”, of Madrid, running through the issues from
September, 1889, to January, 1890.</p>
<p>It supplements Rizal’s great novel “Noli Me
Tangere” and its sequel “El Filibusterismo”, and the
translation here given is fortunately by Mr. Charles Derbyshire who in
his “The Social Cancer” and “The Reign of
Greed” has so happily rendered into English those masterpieces of
Rizal.</p>
<p>The reference which Doctor Rizal makes to President Harrison had in
mind the grandson-of-his-grandfather’s blundering, wavering
policy that, because of a groundless fear of infringing the
natives’ natural rights, put his country in <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#xd20e272" id="xd20e272" class="pginternal">10</a>]</span>the false light of wanting to share in
Samoa’s exploitation, taking the leonine portion, too, along with
Germany and England.</p>
<p>Robert Louis Stevenson has told the story of the unhappy condition
created by that disastrous international agreement which was achieved
by the dissembling diplomats of greedy Europe flattering
unsophisticated America into believing that two monarchies
preponderating in an alliance with a republic would be fairer than the
republic acting unhampered.</p>
<p>In its day the scheme was acclaimed by irrational idealists as a
triumph of American abnegation and an example of modern altruism. It
resulted that “the international agreement” became a
constant cause of international disagreements, as any student of
history could have foretold, until, disgusted and disillusioned, the
United States tardily recalled Washington’s warning against
entanglements with foreign powers and became a party to a real
partition, <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#xd20e278" id="xd20e278" class="pginternal">11</a>]</span>but this time playing the lamb’s
part. England was compensated with concessions in other parts of the
world, the United States was “given” what it already held
under a cession twenty-seven years old,—and Germany took the rest
as her emperor had planned from the start.</p>
<p>There is this Philippine bearing to the incident that the same
stripe of unpractical philanthropists, not discouraged at having forced
the Samoans under the ungentle German rule—for their victims and
not themselves suffer by their mistakes, are seeking now the
neutralization by international agreement of the Archipelago for which
Rizal gave his life. Their success would mean another “entangling
alliance” for the United States, with six allies, or nine
including Holland, China and Spain, if the “great republic”
should be allowed by the diplomats of the “Great Powers” to
invite these nonentities in world politics, with whom she would still
be outvoted. <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#xd20e282" id="xd20e282" class="pginternal">12</a>]</span></p>
<p>Rizal’s reference to America as a possible factor in the
Philippines’ future is based upon the prediction of the German
traveller Feodor Jagor, who about 1860 spent a number of months in the
Islands and later published his observations, supplemented by ten years
of further study in European libraries and museums, as “Travels
in the Philippines”, to use the title of the English
translation,—a very poor one, by the way. Rizal read the much
better Spanish version while a student in the Ateneo de Manila, from a
copy supplied by Paciano Rizal Mercado who directed his younger
brother’s political education and transferred to José the
hopes which had been blighted for himself by the execution of his
beloved teacher, Father Burgos, in the Cavite alleged insurrection.</p>
<p>Jagor’s prophecy furnishes the explanation to Rizal’s
public life. His policy of preparing his countrymen for industrial and
commercial <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#xd20e287" id="xd20e287" class="pginternal">13</a>]</span>competition seems to have had its
inspiration in this reading done when he was a youth in years but
mature in fact through close contact with tragic public events as well
as with sensational private sorrows.</p>
<p>When in Berlin, Doctor Rizal met Professor Jagor, and the
distinguished geographer and his youthful but brilliant admirer became
fast friends, often discussing how the progress of events was bringing
true the fortune for the Philippines which the knowledge of its history
and the acquaintance with its then condition had enabled the trained
observer to foretell with that same certainty that the meteorologist
foretells the morrow’s weather.</p>
<p>A like political acumen Rizal tried to develop in his countrymen. He
republished Morga’s History (first published in Mexico in 1609)
to recall their past. Noli Me Tangere painted their present, and in El
Filibusterismo was <span class="corr" title="Source: sketchod" id="xd20e293">sketched</span> the future which continuance upon
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#xd20e296" id="xd20e296" class="pginternal">14</a>]</span>their then course must bring. “The
Philippines A Century Hence” suggests other possibilities, and
seems to have been the initial issue in the series of ten which Rizal
planned to print, one a year, to correct the misunderstanding of his
previous writings which had come from their being known mainly by the
extracts cited in the censors’ criticism.</p>
<p>José Rizal in life voiced the aspirations of his countrymen
and as the different elements in his divided native land recognized
that these were the essentials upon which all were agreed and that
their points of difference among themselves were not vital, dissension
disappeared and there came an united Philippines. Now, since his death,
the fact that both continental and insular Americans look to him as
their hero makes possible the hope that misunderstandings based on
differences as to details may cease when Filipinos recognize that the
American Government in the Philippines, properly approached, is willing
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#xd20e301" id="xd20e301" class="pginternal">15</a>]</span>to grant all that Rizal considered important,
and when Americans understand that the people of the Philippines,
unaccustomed to the frank discussions of democracy, would be content
with so little even as Rizal asked of Spain if only there were some
salve for their unwittingly wounded <i>amor propio</i>.</p>
<p>A better knowledge of the writings of José Rizal may
accomplish this desirable consummation. <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#xd20e308" id="xd20e308" class="pginternal">16</a>]</span></p>

<p class="first"><i>This extract is translated from Pages 287–289
of “<span lang="de">Reisen in den Philippinen von F. Jagor:
Berlin 1873</span>”.</i></p>
<p>“The old situation is no longer possible of maintenance, with
the changed conditions of the present time.</p>
<p>“The colony can no longer be kept secluded from the world.
Every facility afforded for commercial intercourse is a blow to the old
system, and a great step made in the direction of broad and liberal
reforms. The more foreign capital and foreign ideas and customs are
introduced, increasing the prosperity, enlightenment, and self respect
of the population, the more impatiently will the existing evils be
endured.</p>
<p>“England can and does open her possessions unconcernedly to
the world. The British colonies are united to the mother country by the
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb20" id="pb20" class="pginternal">20</a>]</span>bond of mutual advantage, viz., the production of
raw material by means of English capital, and the exchange of the same
for English manufactures. The wealth of England is so great, the
organization of her commerce with the world so complete, that nearly
all the foreigners even in the British possessions are for the most
part agents for English business houses, which would scarcely be
affected, at least to any marked extent, by a political dismemberment.
It is entirely different with Spain, which possesses the colony as an
inherited property, and without the power of turning it to any useful
account.</p>
<p>“Government monopolies rigorously maintained, insolent
disregard and neglect of the half-castes and powerful creoles, and the
example of the United States, were the chief reasons of the downfall of
the American possessions. The same causes threaten ruin to the
Philippines; but of the monopolies I have said enough. <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb21" id="pb21" class="pginternal">21</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Half-castes and creoles, it is true, are not, as they
formerly were in America, excluded from all official appointments; but
they feel deeply hurt and injured through the crowds of place-hunters
which the frequent changes of Ministers send to Manila.</p>
<p>“Also the influence of American elements is at least
discernible on the horizon, and will come more to the front as the
relations of the two countries grow closer. At present these are still
of little importance; in the meantime commerce follows its old routes,
which lead to England and the Atlantic ports of the Union.
Nevertheless, he who attempts to form a judgment as to the future
destiny of the Philippines cannot fix his gaze only on their relations
to Spain; he must also consider the mighty changes which within a few
decades are being effected on that side of our planet. For the first
time in the world’s history, the gigantic nations on both sides
of a gigantic ocean are beginning to <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb22" id="pb22" class="pginternal">22</a>]</span>come into direct
intercourse: Russia, which alone is greater than two divisions of the
world together; China, which within her narrow bounds contains a third
of the human race; <i>America</i>, with cultivable soil enough to
support almost three times the entire population of the earth.
Russia’s future rôle in the Pacific Ocean at present
baffles all calculations. The intercourse of the two other powers will
probably have all the more important consequences when the adjustment
between the immeasurable necessity for human labor-power on the one
hand, and a correspondingly great surplus of that power on the other,
shall fall on it as a problem.”</p>
<p>“The world of the ancients was confined to the shores of the
Mediterranean; and the Atlantic and Indian Oceans sufficed at one time
for our traffic. When first the shores of the Pacific re-echoed with
the sounds of active commerce, the trade of the world and the history
of the world may be really said to have <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb23" id="pb23" class="pginternal">23</a>]</span>begun. A start in that
direction has been made; whereas not so very long ago the immense ocean
was one wide waste of waters, traversed from both points only once a
year. From 1603 to 1769 scarcely a ship had ever visited California,
that wonderful country which, twenty-five years ago, with the exception
of a few places on the coast, was an unknown wilderness, but which is
now covered with flourishing and prosperous towns and cities, divided
from sea to sea by a railway, and its capital already ranking among the
world’s greatest seaports.</p>
<p>“But in proportion as the commerce of the western coast of
America extends the influence of the American elements over the South
Sea, the ensnaring spell which the great republic exercises over the
Spanish colonies will not fail to assert itself in the Philippines
also. The Americans appear to be called upon to bring the germ planted
by the Spaniards to its full development. As conquerors of the New
World, <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb24" id="pb24" class="pginternal">24</a>]</span>representatives of the body of free citizens in
contradistinction to the nobility, they follow with the axe and plow of
the pioneer where the Spaniards had opened the way with cross and
sword. A considerable part of Spanish America already belongs to the
United States, and has, since that occurred, attained an importance
which could not have been anticipated either during Spanish rule or
during the anarchy which ensued after and from it. In the long run, the
Spanish system cannot prevail over the American. While the former
exhausts the colonies through direct appropriation of them to the
privileged classes, and the metropolis through the drain of its best
forces (with, besides, a feeble population), America draws to itself
the most energetic element from all lands; and these on her soil, free
from all trammels, and restlessly pushing forward, are continually
extending further her power and influence. The Philippines will so much
the less escape the influence of the <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb25" id="pb25" class="pginternal">25</a>]</span>two great neighboring
empires, since neither the islands nor their metropolis are in a
condition of stable equilibrium. It seems desirable for the natives
that the opinions here expressed shall not too soon be realized as
facts, for their training thus far has not sufficiently prepared them
for success in the contest with those restless, active, most
inconsiderate peoples; they have dreamed away their youth.”

<p class="first">Following our usual custom of facing squarely the most
difficult and delicate questions relating to the Philippines, without
weighing the consequences that our frankness may bring upon us, we
shall in the present article treat of their future.</p>
<p>In order to read the destiny of a people, it is necessary to open
the book of its past, and this, for the Philippines, may be reduced in
general terms to what follows.</p>
<p>Scarcely had they been attached to the Spanish crown than they had
to sustain with their blood and the efforts of their sons the wars and
ambitions of conquest of the Spanish people, and in these struggles, in
that terrible <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb32" id="pb32" class="pginternal">32</a>]</span>crisis when a people changes its form of
government, its laws, usages, customs, religion and beliefs the
Philippines were depopulated, impoverished and retarded—caught in
their metamorphosis, without confidence in their past, without faith in
their present and with no fond hope for the years to come. The former
rulers who had merely endeavored to secure the fear and submission of
their subjects, habituated by them to servitude, fell like leaves from
a dead tree, and the people, who had no love for them nor knew what
liberty was, easily changed masters, perhaps hoping to gain something
by the innovation.</p>
<p>Then began a new era for the Filipinos. They gradually lost their
ancient traditions, their recollections—they forgot their
writings, their songs, their poetry, their laws, in order to learn by
heart other doctrines, which they did not understand, other ethics,
other tastes, different from those inspired in their race by their
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb33" id="pb33" class="pginternal">33</a>]</span>climate and their way of thinking. Then there was
a falling-off, they were lowered in their own eyes, they became ashamed
of what was distinctively their own, in order to admire and praise what
was foreign and incomprehensible: their spirit was broken and they
acquiesced.</p>
<p>Thus years and centuries rolled on. Religious shows, rites that
caught the eye, songs, lights, images arrayed with gold, worship in a
strange language, legends, miracles and sermons, hypnotized the already
naturally superstitious spirit of the country, but did not succeed in
destroying it altogether, in spite of the whole system afterwards
developed and operated with unyielding tenacity.</p>
<p>When the ethical abasement of the inhabitants had reached this
stage, when they had become disheartened and disgusted with themselves,
an effort was made to add the final stroke for reducing so many dormant
wills and intellects to nothingness, in order to make of the individual
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb34" id="pb34" class="pginternal">34</a>]</span>a sort of toiler, a brute, a beast of burden, and
to develop a race without mind or heart. Then the end sought was
revealed, it was taken for granted, the race was insulted, an effort
was made to deny it every virtue, every human characteristic, and there
were even writers and priests who pushed the movement still further by
trying to deny to the natives of the country not only capacity for
virtue but also even the tendency to vice.</p>
<p>Then this which they had thought would be death was sure salvation.
Some dying persons are restored to health by a heroic remedy.</p>
<p>So great endurance reached its climax with the insults, and the
lethargic spirit woke to life. His sensitiveness, the chief trait of
the native, was touched, and while he had had the forbearance to suffer
and die under a foreign flag, he had it not when they whom he served
repaid his sacrifices with insults and jests. Then he began to study
himself and to realize his misfortune. <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb35" id="pb35" class="pginternal">35</a>]</span>Those who had not
expected this result, like all despotic masters, regarded as a wrong
every complaint, every protest, and punished it with death, endeavoring
thus to stifle every cry of sorrow with blood, and they made mistake
after mistake.</p>
<p>The spirit of the people was not thereby cowed, and even though it
had been awakened in only a few hearts, its flame nevertheless was
surely and consumingly propagated, thanks to abuses and the stupid
endeavors of certain classes to stifle noble and generous sentiments.
Thus when a flame catches a garment, fear and confusion propagate it
more and more, and each shake, each blow, is a blast from the bellows
to fan it into life.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly during all this time there were not lacking generous and
noble spirits among the dominant race that tried to struggle for the
rights of humanity and justice, or sordid and cowardly ones among the
dominated that aided <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb36" id="pb36" class="pginternal">36</a>]</span>the debasement of their own country. But both
were exceptions and we are speaking in general terms.</p>
<p>Such is an outline of their past. We know their present. Now, what
will their future be?</p>
<p>Will the Philippine Islands continue to be a Spanish colony, and if
so, what kind of colony? Will they become a province of Spain, with or
without autonomy? And to reach this stage, what kind of sacrifices will
have to be made?</p>
<p>Will they be separated from the mother country to live
independently, to fall into the hands of other nations, or to ally
themselves with neighboring powers?</p>
<p>It is impossible to reply to these questions, for to all of them
both <i>yes</i> and <i>no</i> may be answered, according to the time
desired to be covered. When there is in nature no fixed condition, how
much less must there be in the life of a people, beings endowed with
mobility and movement! So it is that in order to deal <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb37" id="pb37" class="pginternal">37</a>]</span>with
these questions, it is necessary to presume an unlimited period of
time, and in accordance therewith try to forecast future events.

<p class="first">What will become of the Philippines within a century?
Will they continue to be a Spanish colony?</p>
<p>Had this question been asked three centuries ago, when at
Legazpi’s death the Malayan Filipinos began to be gradually
undeceived and, finding the yoke heavy, tried in vain to shake it off,
without any doubt whatsoever the reply would have been easy. To a
spirit enthusiastic over the liberty of the country, to those
unconquerable Kagayanes who nourished within themselves the spirit of
the Magalats, to the descendants of the heroic Gat Pulintang and Gat
Salakab of the Province of Batangas, independence was assured, it was
merely a question <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb42" id="pb42" class="pginternal">42</a>]</span>of getting together and making a determined
effort. But for him who, disillusioned by sad experience, saw
everywhere discord and disorder, apathy and brutalization in the lower
classes, discouragement and disunion in the upper, only one answer
presented itself, and it was: extend his hands to the chains, bow his
neck beneath the yoke and accept the future with the resignation of an
invalid who watches the leaves fall and foresees a long winter amid
whose snows he discerns the outlines of his grave. At that time discord
justified pessimism—but three centuries passed, the neck had
become accustomed to the yoke, and each new generation, begotten in
chains, was constantly better adapted to the new order of things.</p>
<p>Now, then, are the Philippines in the same condition they were three
centuries ago?</p>
<p>For the liberal Spaniards the ethical condition of the people
remains the same, that is, the native Filipinos have not advanced; for
the <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb43" id="pb43" class="pginternal">43</a>]</span>friars and their followers the people have been
redeemed from savagery, that is, they have progressed; for many
Filipinos ethics, spirit and customs have decayed, as decay all the
good qualities of a people that falls into slavery that is, they have
retrograded.</p>
<p>Laying aside these considerations, so as not to get away from our
subject, let us draw a brief parallel between the political situation
then and the situation at present, in order to see if what was not
possible at that time can be so now, or <i>vice versa</i>.</p>
<p>Let us pass over the loyalty the Filipinos may feel for Spain; let
us suppose for a moment, along with Spanish writers, that there exist
only motives for hatred and jealousy between the two races; let us
admit the assertions flaunted by many that three centuries of
domination have not awakened in the sensitive heart of the native a
single spark of affection or gratitude; and we may see whether or not
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb44" id="pb44" class="pginternal">44</a>]</span>the Spanish cause has gained ground in the
Islands.</p>
<p>Formerly the Spanish authority was upheld among the natives by a
handful of soldiers, three to five hundred at most, many of whom were
engaged in trade and were scattered about not only in the Islands but
also among the neighboring nations, occupied in long wars against the
Mohammedans in the south, against the British and Dutch, and
ceaselessly harassed by Japanese, Chinese, or some tribe in the
interior<span class="corr" title="Not in source" id="xd20e442">.</span>
Then communication with Mexico and Spain was slow, rare and difficult;
frequent and violent the disturbances among the ruling powers in the
Islands, the treasury nearly always empty, and the life of the
colonists dependent upon one frail ship that handled the Chinese trade.
Then the seas in those regions were infested with pirates, all enemies
of the Spanish name, which was defended by an improvised fleet,
generally manned by rude adventurers, when not by foreigners and
enemies, <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb45" id="pb45" class="pginternal">45</a>]</span>as happened in the expedition of Gómez
Pérez Dasmariñas, which was checked and frustrated by the
mutiny of the Chinese rowers, who killed him and thwarted all his plans
and schemes. Yet in spite of so many adverse circumstances the Spanish
authority has been upheld for more than three centuries and, though it
has been curtailed, still continues to rule the destinies of the
Philippine group.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the present situation seems to be gilded and
rosy—as we might say, a beautiful morning compared to the vexed
and stormy night of the past. The material forces at the disposal of
the Spanish sovereign have now been trebled; the fleet relatively
improved; there is more organization in both civil and military
affairs; communication with the sovereign country is swifter and surer;
she has no enemies abroad; her possession is assured; and the country
dominated seems to have less spirit, less aspiration for independence,
a word that is to it almost incomprehensible. Everything then at first
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb46" id="pb46" class="pginternal">46</a>]</span>glance presages another three centuries, at least,
of peaceful domination and tranquil suzerainty.</p>
<p>But above the material considerations are arising others, invisible,
of an ethical nature, far more powerful and transcendental.</p>
<p>Orientals, and the Malays in particular, are a sensitive people:
delicacy of sentiment is predominant with them. Even now, in spite of
contact with the occidental nations, who have ideals different from
his, we see the Malayan Filipino sacrifice everything—liberty,
ease, welfare, name, for the sake of an aspiration or a conceit,
sometimes scientific, or of some other nature, but at the least word
which wounds his self-love he forgets all his sacrifices, the labor
expended, to treasure in his memory and never forget the slight he
thinks he has received.</p>
<p>So the Philippine peoples have remained faithful during three
centuries, giving up their liberty and their independence, sometimes
dazzled by <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb47" id="pb47" class="pginternal">47</a>]</span>the hope of the Paradise promised, sometimes
cajoled by the friendship offered them by a noble and generous people
like the Spanish, sometimes also compelled by superiority of arms of
which they were ignorant and which timid spirits invested with a
mysterious character, or sometimes because the invading foreigner took
advantage of intestine feuds to step in as the peacemaker in discord
and thus later to dominate both parties and subject them to his
authority.</p>
<p>Spanish domination once established, it was firmly maintained,
thanks to the attachment of the people, to their mutual dissensions,
and to the fact that the sensitive self-love of the native had not yet
been wounded. Then the people saw their own countrymen in the higher
ranks of the army, their general officers fighting beside the heroes of
Spain and sharing their laurels, begrudged neither character,
reputation nor consideration; then fidelity and attachment to Spain,
love of the fatherland, made of the <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb48" id="pb48" class="pginternal">48</a>]</span>native,
<i>encomendero</i><a class="noteref pginternal" href="#xd20e466" id="xd20e466src">1</a> and even general, as during the English
invasion; then there had not yet been invented the insulting and
ridiculous epithets with which recently the most laborious and painful
<span class="corr" title="Source: achievments" id="xd20e475">achievements</span> of the native leaders have
been stigmatized; not then had it become the fashion to insult and
slander in stereotyped phrase, in newspapers and books published with
governmental and superior ecclesiastical approval, the people that
paid, fought and poured out its blood for the Spanish name, nor was it
considered either noble or witty to offend a whole race, which was
forbidden to reply or defend itself; and if there were religious
hypochondriacs who in the leisure of their cloisters dared to write
against it, as did the Augustinian <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb49" id="pb49" class="pginternal">49</a>]</span>Gaspar de San Agustin and the
Jesuit Velarde, their loathsome abortions never saw the light, and
still less were they themselves rewarded with miters and raised to high
offices. True it is that neither were the natives of that time such as
we are now: three centuries of brutalization and obscurantism have
necessarily had some influence upon us, the most beautiful work of
divinity in the hands of certain artisans may finally be converted into
a caricature.</p><div id="hisFocus"></div>
<p>The priests of that epoch, wishing to establish their domination
over the people, got in touch with it and made common cause with it
against the oppressive <i>encomenderos</i>. Naturally, the people saw
in them greater learning and some prestige and placed its confidence in
them, followed their advice, and listened to them even in the darkest
hours. If they wrote, they did so in defense of the rights of the
native and made his cry reach even to the distant steps of the Throne.
And not a few priests, both secular <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb50" id="pb50" class="pginternal">50</a>]</span>and regular, undertook dangerous
journeys, as representatives of the country, and this, along with the
strict and public <i>residencia</i><a class="noteref pginternal" href="#xd20e489" id="xd20e489src">2</a> then required of the
governing powers, from the captain-general to the most insignificant
official, rather consoled and pacified the wounded spirits, satisfying,
even though it were only in form, all the malcontents.</p>
<p>All this has passed away. The derisive laughter penetrates like
mortal poison into the heart of the native who pays and suffers and it
becomes more offensive the more immunity it enjoys. A common sore, the
general affront offered to a whole race, has wiped away the old feuds
among different provinces. The people no longer has confidence in its
former protectors, <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb51" id="pb51" class="pginternal">51</a>]</span>now its exploiters and executioners. The
masks have fallen. It has seen that the love and piety of the past have
come to resemble the devotion of a nurse who, unable to live elsewhere,
desires eternal infancy, eternal weakness, for the child in order to go
on drawing her wages and existing at its expense; it has seen not only
that she does not nourish it to make it grow but that she poisons it to
stunt its growth, and at the slightest protest she flies into a rage!
The ancient show of justice, the holy <i>residencia</i>, has
disappeared; confusion of ideas begins to prevail; the regard shown for
a governor-general, like La Torre, becomes a crime in the government of
his successor, sufficient to cause the citizen to lose his liberty and
his home; if he obey the order of one official, as in the recent matter
of admitting corpses into the church, it is enough to have the obedient
subject later harassed and persecuted in every possible way;
obligations and taxes increase without thereby increasing rights,
privileges <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb52" id="pb52" class="pginternal">52</a>]</span>and liberties or assuring the few in existence; a
régime of continual terror and uncertainty disturbs the minds, a
régime worse than a period of disorder, for the fears that the
imagination conjures up are generally greater than the reality; the
country is poor; the financial crisis through which it is passing is
acute, and every one points out with the finger the persons who are
causing the trouble, yet no one dares lay hands upon them!</p>
<p>True it is that the Penal Code has come like a drop of balm to such
bitterness.<a class="noteref pginternal" href="#xd20e509" id="xd20e509src">3</a> But of what use are all the codes in the world, if
by means of confidential reports, if for trifling reasons, if through
anonymous traitors any honest citizen may be exiled or banished without
a hearing, without a trial? Of what use is that Penal Code, of what use
is life, if there is no security in the home, no faith in justice and
confidence <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb53" id="pb53" class="pginternal">53</a>]</span>in tranquility of conscience? Of what use is all
that array of terms, all that collection of articles, when the cowardly
accusation of a traitor has more influence in the timorous ears of the
supreme autocrat than all the cries for justice?</p>
<p>If this state of affairs should continue, what will become of the
Philippines within a century?</p>
<p>The batteries are gradually becoming charged and if the prudence of
the government does not provide an outlet for the currents that are
accumulating, some day the spark will be generated. This is not the
place to speak of what outcome such a deplorable conflict might have,
for it depends upon chance, upon the weapons and upon a thousand
circumstances which man can not foresee. But even though all the
advantage should be on the government’s side and therefore the
probability of success, it would be a Pyrrhic victory, and no
government ought to desire such. <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb54" id="pb54" class="pginternal">54</a>]</span></p>
<p>If those who guide the destinies of the Philippines remain
obstinate, and instead of introducing reforms try to make the condition
of the country retrograde, to push their severity and repression to
extremes against the classes that suffer and think, they are going to
force the latter to venture and put into play the wretchedness of an
unquiet life, filled with privation and bitterness, against the hope of
securing something indefinite. What would be lost in the struggle?
Almost nothing: the life of the numerous <span class="corr" title="Source: dicontented" id="xd20e521">discontented</span> classes has
no such great attraction that it should be preferred to a glorious
death. It may indeed be a suicidal attempt—but then, what? Would
not a bloody chasm yawn between victors and vanquished, and might not
the latter with time and experience become equal in strength, since
they are superior in numbers, to their dominators? Who disputes this?
All the petty insurrections that have occurred in the Philippines were
the <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb55" id="pb55" class="pginternal">55</a>]</span>work of a few fanatics or discontented soldiers,
who had to deceive and humbug the people or avail themselves of their
power over their subordinates to gain their ends. So they all failed.
No insurrection had a popular character or was based on a need of the
whole race or fought for human rights or justice, so it left no
ineffaceable impressions, but rather when they saw that they had been
duped the people bound up their wounds and applauded the overthrow of
the disturbers of their peace! But what if the movement springs from
the people themselves and bases its cause upon their woes?</p>
<p>So then, if the prudence and wise reforms of our ministers do not
find capable and determined interpreters among the colonial governors
and faithful perpetuators among those whom the frequent political
changes send to fill such a delicate post; if met with the eternal
<i>it is out of order</i>, proffered by the elements who see their
livelihood in the backwardness of their subjects; <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb56" id="pb56" class="pginternal">56</a>]</span>if just
claims are to go unheeded, as being of a subversive tendency; if the
country is denied representation in the Cortes and an authorized voice
to cry out against all kinds of abuses, which escape through the
complexity of the laws; if, in short, the system, prolific in results
of alienating the good will of the natives, is to continue, pricking
his <i>apathetic</i> mind with insults and charges of ingratitude, we
can assert that in a few years the present state of affairs will have
been modified completely—and inevitably. There now exists a
factor which was formerly lacking—the spirit of the nation has
been aroused, and a common misfortune, a common debasement, has united
all the inhabitants of the Islands. A numerous enlightened class now
exists within and without the Islands, a class created and continually
augmented by the stupidity of certain governing powers, which forces
the inhabitants to leave the country, to secure education abroad, and
it is <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb57" id="pb57" class="pginternal">57</a>]</span>maintained and struggles thanks to the
provocations and the system of espionage in vogue. This class, whose
number is cumulatively increasing, is in constant communication with
the rest of the Islands, and if today it constitutes only the brain of
the country in a few years it will form the whole nervous system and
manifest its existence in all its acts.</p>
<p>Now, statecraft has various means at its disposal for checking a
people on the road to progress: the brutalization of the masses through
a caste addicted to the government, aristocratic, as in the Dutch
colonies, or theocratic, as in the Philippines; the impoverishment of
the country; the gradual extermination of the inhabitants; and the
fostering of feuds among the races.</p>
<p>Brutalization of the Malayan Filipino has been demonstrated to be
impossible. In spite of the dark horde of friars, in whose hands rests
the instruction of youth, which miserably wastes years and years in the
<i>colleges</i>, issuing therefrom <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb58" id="pb58" class="pginternal">58</a>]</span>tired, weary and disgusted with
books; in spite of the censorship, which tries to close every avenue to
progress; in spite of all the pulpits, confessionals, books and missals
that inculcate hatred toward not only all scientific knowledge but even
toward the Spanish language itself; in spite of this whole elaborate
system perfected and tenaciously operated by those who wish to keep the
Islands in holy ignorance, there exist writers, freethinkers,
historians, philosophers, chemists, physicians, artists and jurists.
Enlightenment is spreading and the persecution it suffers quickens it.
No, the divine flame of thought is inextinguishable in the Filipino
people and somehow or other it will shine forth and compel recognition.
It is impossible to brutalize the inhabitants of the Philippines!</p>
<p>May poverty arrest their development?</p>
<p>Perhaps, but it is a very dangerous means. Experience has everywhere
shown us and especially in the Philippines, that the classes which
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb59" id="pb59" class="pginternal">59</a>]</span>are better off have always been addicted to peace
and order, because they live comparatively <span class="corr" title="Source: betare" id="xd20e554">better</span> and may be the losers
in civil disturbances<span class="corr" title="Not in source" id="xd20e557">.</span> Wealth brings with it refinement, the spirit
of conservation, while poverty inspires adventurous ideas, the desire
to change things, and has <span class="corr" title="Source: littles" id="xd20e560">little</span> care for life. Machiavelli himself held
this means of subjecting a people to be perilous, observing that loss
of welfare stirs up more obdurate enemies than loss of life. Moreover,
when there are wealth and abundance, there is less discontent, less
complaint, and the government, itself wealthier, has more means for
sustaining itself. On the other hand, there occurs in a poor country
what happens in a house where bread is wanting. And further, of what
use to the mother country would a poor and lean colony be?</p>
<p>Neither is it possible gradually to exterminate the inhabitants. The
Philippine races, like all the Malays, do not succumb before the
foreigner, <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb60" id="pb60" class="pginternal">60</a>]</span>like the Australians, the Polynesians and the
Indians of the New World. In spite of the numerous wars the Filipinos
have had to carry on, in spite of the epidemics that have periodically
visited them, their number has trebled, as has that of the Malays of
Java and the Moluccas. The Filipino embraces civilization and lives and
thrives in every clime, in contact with every people. Rum, that poison
which exterminated the natives of the Pacific islands, has no power in
the Philippines, but, rather, comparison of their present condition
with that described by the early historians, makes it appear that the
Filipinos have grown soberer. The petty wars with the inhabitants of
the South consume only the soldiers, people who by their fidelity to
the Spanish flag, far from being a menace, are surely one of its
solidest supports.</p>
<p>There remains the fostering of intestine feuds among the
provinces.</p>
<p>This was formerly possible, when communication from one island to
another was rare and <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb61" id="pb61" class="pginternal">61</a>]</span>difficult, when there were no steamers or
telegraph-lines, when the regiments were formed according to the
various provinces, when some provinces were cajoled by awards of
privileges and honors and others were protected from the strongest. But
now that the privileges have disappeared, that through a spirit of
distrust the regiments have been reorganized, that the inhabitants move
from one island to another, communication and exchange of impressions
naturally increase, and as all see themselves threatened by the same
peril and wounded in the same feelings, they clasp hands and make
common cause. It is true that the union is not yet wholly perfected,
but to this end tend the measures of good government, the vexations to
which the townspeople are subjected, the frequent changes of officials,
the scarcity of centers of learning, which forces the youth of all the
Islands to come together and begin to get acquainted. The journeys to
Europe contribute not a little to tighten the bonds, for abroad the
inhabitants <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb62" id="pb62" class="pginternal">62</a>]</span>of the most widely separated provinces are
impressed by their patriotic feelings, from sailors even to the
wealthiest merchants, and at the sight of modern liberty and the memory
of the misfortunes of their country, they embrace and call one another
brothers.</p>
<p>In short, then, the advancement and ethical progress of the
Philippines are inevitable, are decreed by fate.</p>
<p>The Islands cannot remain in the condition they are without
requiring from the sovereign country more liberty <i>Mutatis
mutandis</i>. For new men, a new social order.</p>
<p>To wish that the alleged child remain in its swaddling-clothes is to
risk that it may turn against its nurse and flee, tearing away the old
rags that bind it.</p>
<p>The Philippines, then, will remain under Spanish domination, but
with more law and greater liberty, or they will declare themselves
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb63" id="pb63" class="pginternal">63</a>]</span>independent, after steeping themselves and the
mother country in blood.</p>
<p>As no one should desire or hope for such an unfortunate rupture,
which would be an evil for all and only the final argument in the most
desperate predicament, let us see by what forms of peaceful evolution
the Islands may remain subjected to the Spanish authority with the very
least detriment to the rights, interests and dignity of both parties.

<p class="first">If the Philippines must remain under the control of
Spain, they will necessarily have to be transformed in a political
sense, for the course of their history and the needs of their
inhabitants so require. This we demonstrated in the preceding
article.</p>
<p>We also said that this transformation will be violent and fatal if
it proceeds from the ranks of the people, but peaceful and fruitful if
it emanate from the upper classes.</p>
<p>Some governors have realized this truth, and, impelled by their
patriotism, have been trying to introduce needed reforms in order to
forestall events. But notwithstanding all that have been ordered up to
the present time, they have <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb68" id="pb68" class="pginternal">68</a>]</span>produced scanty results, for the
government as well as for the country. Even those that promised only a
happy issue have at times caused injury, for the simple reason that
they have been based upon unstable grounds.</p>
<p>We said, and once more we repeat, and will ever assert, that reforms
which have a <i>palliative</i> character are not only ineffectual but
even prejudicial, when the government is confronted with evils that
must be cured <i>radically</i>. And were we not convinced of the
honesty and rectitude of some governors, we would be tempted to say
that all the partial reforms are only plasters and salves of a
physician who, not knowing how to cure the cancer, and not daring to
root it out, tries in this way to alleviate the patient’s
sufferings or to temporize with the cowardice of the timid and
ignorant.</p>
<p>All the reforms of our liberal ministers were, have been, are, and
will be good—when carried out. <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb69" id="pb69" class="pginternal">69</a>]</span></p>
<p>When we think of them, we are reminded of the dieting of Sancho
Panza in his Barataria Island. He took his seat at a sumptuous and
well-appointed table “covered with fruit and many varieties of
food differently prepared,” but between the wretch’s mouth
and each dish the physician Pedro Rezio interposed his wand, saying,
“Take it away!” The dish removed, Sancho was as hungry as
ever. True it is that the despotic Pedro Rezio gave reasons, which seem
to have been written by Cervantes especially for the colonial
administrations: “You must not eat, Mr. Governor, except
according to the usage and custom of other islands where there are
governors.” Something was found to be wrong with each dish: one
was too hot, another too moist, and so on, just like our Pedro Rezios
on both sides of the sea. Great good did his cook’s skill do
Sancho!<a class="noteref pginternal" href="#xd20e615" id="xd20e615src">4</a></p>
<p>In the case of our country, the reforms take <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb70" id="pb70" class="pginternal">70</a>]</span>the
place of the dishes, the Philippines are Sancho, while the part of the
quack physician is played by many persons, interested in not having the
dishes touched, perhaps that they may themselves get the benefit of
them.</p>
<p>The result is that the long-suffering Sancho, or the Philippines,
misses his liberty, rejects all government and ends up by rebelling
against his quack physician.</p>
<p>In like manner, so long as the Philippines have no liberty of the
press, have no voice in the Cortes to make known to the government and
to the nation whether or not their decrees have been duly obeyed,
whether or not these benefit the country, all the able efforts of the
colonial ministers will meet the fate of the dishes in Barataria
island.</p>
<p>The minister, then, who wants his reforms to be reforms, must begin
by declaring the press in the Philippines free and by instituting
Filipino delegates. <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb71" id="pb71" class="pginternal">71</a>]</span></p>
<p>The press <span class="corr" title="Not in source" id="xd20e635">is</span> free in the Philippines, because their
complaints rarely ever reach the Peninsula, very rarely, and if they do
they are so secret, so mysterious, that no newspaper dares to publish
them, or if it does reproduce them, it does so tardily and badly.</p>
<p>A government that <i>rules a country from a great distance</i> is
the one that has the most need for a free press, more so even than the
government of the home country, if it wishes to rule rightly and fitly.
The government that <i>governs in a country</i> may even dispense with
the press (if it can), because it is on the ground, because it has eyes
and ears, and because it directly observes what it rules and
administers. But the government that <i>governs from afar</i>
absolutely requires that the truth and the facts reach its knowledge by
every possible channel, so that it may weigh and estimate them better,
and this need increases when a country like the Philippines is
concerned, where the inhabitants speak and <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb72" id="pb72" class="pginternal">72</a>]</span>complain
in a language unknown to the authorities. To govern in any other way
may also be called governing, but it is to govern badly. It amounts to
pronouncing judgment after hearing only one of the parties; it is
steering a ship without reckoning its conditions, the state of the sea,
the reefs and shoals, the direction of the winds and currents. It is
managing a house by endeavoring merely to give it polish and a fine
appearance without watching the money-chest, without looking after the
servants and the members of the family.</p>
<p>But routine is a declivity down which many governments slide, and
routine says that freedom of the press is dangerous. Let us see what
History says: uprisings and revolutions have always occurred in
countries tyrannized over, in countries where human thought and the
human heart have been forced to remain silent.</p>
<p>If the great Napoleon had not tyrannized over the press, perhaps it
would have warned <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb73" id="pb73" class="pginternal">73</a>]</span>him of the peril into which he was hurled and
have made him understand that the people were weary and the earth
wanted peace. Perhaps his genius, instead of being dissipated in
foreign aggrandizement, would have become intensive in laboring to
strengthen his position and thus have assured it. Spain herself records
in her history more revolutions when the press was gagged. What
colonies have become independent while they have had a free press and
enjoyed liberty? Is it preferable to govern blindly or to govern with
ample knowledge?</p>
<p>Some one will answer that in colonies with a free press, the
<i>prestige</i> of the rulers, that prop of false governments, will be
greatly imperiled. We answer that the prestige of the nation is
preferable to that of a few individuals. A nation acquires respect, not
by abetting and concealing abuses, but by rebuking and punishing them.
Moreover, to this prestige is applicable what Napoleon said about great
men <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb74" id="pb74" class="pginternal">74</a>]</span>and their valets. We, who endure and know all the
false pretensions and petty persecutions of those sham gods, do not
need a free press in order to recognize them; they have long ago lost
their prestige. The free press is needed by the government, the
government which still dreams of the prestige which it builds upon
mined ground.</p>
<p>We say the same about the Filipino representatives.</p>
<p>What risks does the government see in them? One of three things:
either that they will prove unruly, become political trimmers, or act
properly.</p>
<p>Supposing that we should yield to the most absurd pessimism and
admit the insult, great for the Philippines, but still greater for
Spain, that all the representatives would be separatists and that in
all their contentions they would advocate separatist ideas: does not a
patriotic Spanish majority exist there, is there not present
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb75" id="pb75" class="pginternal">75</a>]</span>there the vigilance of the governing powers to
combat and oppose such intentions? And would not this be better than
the discontent that ferments and expands in the secrecy of the home, in
the huts and in the fields? Certainly the Spanish people does not spare
its blood where patriotism is concerned, but would not a struggle of
principles in parliament be preferable to the exchange of shot in
swampy lands, three thousand leagues from home, in impenetrable
forests, under a burning sun or amid torrential rains? These pacific
struggles of ideas, besides being a thermometer for the government,
have the advantage of being cheap and glorious, because the Spanish
parliament especially abounds in oratorical paladins, invincible in
debate. Moreover, it is said that the Filipinos are indolent and
peaceful—then what need the government fear? Hasn’t it any
influence in the elections? Frankly, it is a great compliment to the
separatists to fear them in the midst of the Cortes of the nation.
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb76" id="pb76" class="pginternal">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>If they become political trimmers, as is to be expected and as they
probably will be, so much the better for the government and so much the
worse for their constituents. They would be a few more favorable votes,
and the government could laugh openly at the separatists, if any there
be.</p>
<p>If they become what they should be, worthy, honest and faithful to
their trust, they will undoubtedly annoy an ignorant or incapable
minister with their questions, but they will help him to govern and
will be some more honorable figures among the representatives of the
nation.</p>
<p>Now then, if the real objection to the Filipino delegates is that
they smell like Igorots, which so disturbed in open Senate the doughty
General Salamanca, then Don Sinibaldo de Mas, who saw the Igorots in
person and wanted to live with them, can affirm that they will smell at
worst like powder, and Señor Salamanca undoubtedly has no fear
of that odor. And if <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb77" id="pb77" class="pginternal">77</a>]</span>this were all, the Filipinos, who there in
their own country are accustomed to bathe every day, when they become
representatives may give up such a dirty custom, at least during the
legislative session, so as not to offend the delicate nostrils of the
Salamancas with the odor of the bath.</p>
<p>It is useless to answer certain objections of some fine writers
regarding the rather brown skins and faces with somewhat wide nostrils.
Questions of taste are peculiar to each race. China, for example, which
has four hundred million inhabitants and a very ancient civilization,
considers all Europeans ugly and calls them “fan-kwai,” or
red devils. Its taste has a hundred million more adherents than the
European. Moreover, if this is the question, we would have to admit the
inferiority of the Latins, especially the Spaniards, to the Saxons, who
are much whiter.</p>
<p>And so long as it is not asserted that the Spanish parliament is an
assemblage of Adonises, <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb78" id="pb78" class="pginternal">78</a>]</span>Antinouses, pretty boys, and other
like paragons; so long as the purpose of resorting thither is to
legislate and not to philosophize or to wander through imaginary
spheres, we maintain that the government ought not to pause at these
objections. Law has no skin, nor reason nostrils.</p>
<p>So we see no serious reason why the Philippines may not have
representatives. By their institution many malcontents would be
silenced, and instead of blaming its troubles upon the government, as
now happens, the country would bear them better, for it could at least
complain and with its sons among its legislators would in a way become
responsible for their actions.</p>
<p>We are not sure that we serve the true interests of our country by
asking for representatives. We know that the lack of enlightenment, the
indolence, the egotism of our fellow countrymen, and the boldness, the
cunning and the powerful methods of those who wish their obscurantism,
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb79" id="pb79" class="pginternal">79</a>]</span>may convert reform into a harmful instrument. But
we wish to be loyal to the government and we are pointing out to it the
road that appears best to us so that its efforts may not come to grief,
so that discontent may disappear. If after so just, as well as
necessary, a measure has been introduced, the Filipino people are so
stupid and weak that they are treacherous to their own interests, then
let the responsibility fall upon them, let them suffer all the
consequences. Every country gets the fate it deserves, and the
government can say that it has done its duty.</p>
<p>These are the two fundamental reforms, which, properly interpreted
and applied, will dissipate all clouds, assure affection toward Spain,
and make all succeeding reforms fruitful. These are the reforms <i>sine
quibus non</i>.</p>
<p>It is puerile to fear that independence may come through them. The
free press will keep the government in touch with public opinion,
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb80" id="pb80" class="pginternal">80</a>]</span>and the representatives, if they are, as they
ought to be, the best from among the sons of the Philippines, will be
their hostages. With no cause for discontent, how then attempt to stir
up the masses of the people?</p>
<p>Likewise inadmissible is the objection offered by some regarding the
imperfect culture of the majority of the inhabitants. Aside from the
fact that it is not so imperfect as is averred, there is no plausible
reason why the ignorant and the defective (whether through their own or
another’s fault) should be denied representation to look after
them and see that they are not abused. They are the very ones who most
need it. No one ceases to be a man, no one forfeits his rights to
civilization merely by being more or less uncultured, and since the
Filipino is regarded as a fit citizen when he is asked to pay taxes or
shed his blood to defend the fatherland, why must this fitness be
denied him when the question arises of granting him <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb81" id="pb81" class="pginternal">81</a>]</span>some
right? Moreover, how is he to be held responsible for his ignorance,
when it is acknowledged by all, friends and enemies, that his zeal for
learning is so great that even before the coming of the Spaniards every
one could read and write, and that we now see the humblest families
make enormous sacrifices in order that their children may become a
little enlightened, even to the extent of working as servants in order
to learn Spanish? How can the country be expected to become enlightened
under present conditions when we see all the decrees issued by the
government in favor of education meet with Pedro Rezios who prevent
execution thereof, because they have in their hands what they call
education? If the Filipino, then, is sufficiently intelligent to pay
taxes, he must also be able to choose and retain the one who looks
after him and his interests, with the product whereof he serves the
government of his nation. To reason otherwise is to reason stupidly.
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb82" id="pb82" class="pginternal">82</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the laws and the acts of officials are kept under surveillance,
the word justice may cease to be a colonial jest. The thing that makes
the English most respected in their possessions is their strict and
speedy justice, so that the inhabitants repose entire confidence in the
judges. Justice is the foremost virtue of the civilizing races. It
subdues the barbarous nations, while injustice arouses the weakest.</p>
<p>Offices and trusts should be awarded by competition, publishing the
work and the judgment thereon, so that there may be stimulus and that
discontent may not be bred. Then, if the native does not shake off his
<i>indolence</i> he can not complain when he sees all the offices
filled by <i>Castilas</i>.</p>
<p>We presume that it will not be the Spaniard who fears to enter into
this contest, for thus will he be able to prove his superiority by the
superiority of intelligence. Although this is not the custom in the
sovereign country, it <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb83" id="pb83" class="pginternal">83</a>]</span>should be practiced in the colonies, for the
reason that genuine prestige should be sought by means of moral
qualities, because the colonizers ought to be, or at least to seem,
upright, honest and intelligent, just as a man simulates virtues when
he deals with strangers. The offices and trusts so earned will do away
with arbitrary dismissal and develop employees and officials capable
and cognizant of their duties. The offices held by natives, instead of
endangering the Spanish domination, will merely serve to assure it, for
what interest would they have in converting the sure and stable into
the uncertain and problematical? The native is, moreover, very fond of
peace and prefers an humble present to a brilliant future. Let the
various Filipinos still holding office speak in this matter; they are
the most unshaken conservatives.</p>
<p>We could add other minor reforms touching commerce, agriculture,
security of the individual <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb84" id="pb84" class="pginternal">84</a>]</span>and of property, education, and so
on, but these are points with which we shall deal in other articles.
For the present we are satisfied with the outlines, and no one can say
that we ask too much.</p>
<p>There will not be lacking critics to accuse us of Utopianism: but
what is Utopia? Utopia was a country imagined by Thomas Moore, wherein
existed universal suffrage, religious toleration, almost complete
abolition of the death penalty, and so on. When the book was published
these things were looked upon as dreams, impossibilities, that is,
Utopianism. Yet civilization has left the country of Utopia far behind,
the human will and conscience have worked greater miracles, have
abolished slavery and the death penalty for adultery—things
impossible for even Utopia itself!</p>
<p>The French colonies have their representatives. The question has
also been raised in the English parliament of giving representation
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb85" id="pb85" class="pginternal">85</a>]</span>to the Crown colonies, for the others already
enjoy some autonomy. The press there also is free. Only Spain, which in
the sixteenth century was the model nation in civilization, lags far
behind<span class="corr" title="Not in source" id="xd20e733">.</span>
Cuba and Porto Rico, whose inhabitants do not number a third of those
of the Philippines, and who have not made such sacrifices for Spain,
have numerous representatives. The Philippines in the early days had
theirs, who conferred with the King and the Pope on the needs of the
country. They had them in Spain’s critical moments, when she
groaned under the Napoleonic yoke, and they did not take advantage of
the sovereign country’s misfortune like other colonies, but
tightened more firmly the bonds that united them to the nation, giving
proofs of their loyalty; and they continued until many years later.
What crime have the Islands committed that they are deprived of their
rights?</p>
<p>To recapitulate: the Philippines will remain Spanish, if they enter
upon the life of law and <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb86" id="pb86" class="pginternal">86</a>]</span>civilization, if the rights of their
inhabitants are respected, if the other rights due them are granted, if
the liberal policy of the government is carried out without trickery or
meanness, without subterfuges or false interpretations.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if an attempt is made to see in the Islands a lode to be
exploited, a resource to satisfy ambitions, thus to relieve the
sovereign country of taxes, killing the goose that lays the golden eggs
and shutting its ears to all cries of reason, then, however great may
be the loyalty of the Filipinos, it will be impossible to hinder the
operations of the inexorable laws of history. Colonies established to
subserve the policy and the commerce of the <span class="corr" title="Source: soverign" id="xd20e742">sovereign</span> country, all
eventually become independent, said Bachelet, and before Bachelet all
the Phœnecian, Carthaginian, Greek, Roman, English, Portuguese
and Spanish colonies had said it.</p>
<p>Close indeed are the bonds that unite us to Spain. Two peoples do
not live for three centuries <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb87" id="pb87" class="pginternal">87</a>]</span>in continual contact, sharing the
same lot, shedding their blood on the same fields, holding the same
beliefs, worshipping the same God, interchanging the same ideas, but
that ties are formed between them stronger than those fashioned by arms
or fear. Mutual sacrifices and benefits have engendered affection.
Machiavelli, the great reader of the human heart, said: <i lang="it">la
natura degli huomini, é cosi obligarsi per li beneficii che essi
fanno, come per quelli che essi ricevono</i> (it is human nature to be
bound as much by benefits conferred as by those received). All this,
and more, is true, but it is pure sentimentality, and in the arena of
politics stern necessity and interests prevail. Howsoever much the
Filipinos owe Spain, they can not be required to forego their
redemption, to have their liberal and enlightened sons wander about in
exile from their native land, the rudest aspirations stifled in its
atmosphere, the peaceful inhabitant living in constant alarm, with the
fortune <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb88" id="pb88" class="pginternal">88</a>]</span>of the two peoples dependent upon the whim of one
man. Spain can not claim, not even in the name of God himself, that six
millions of people should be brutalized, exploited and oppressed,
denied light and the rights inherent to a human being, and then heap
upon them slights and insults. There is no claim of gratitude that can
excuse, there is not enough powder in the world to justify, the
offenses against the liberty of the individual, against the sanctity of
the home, against the laws, against peace and honor, offenses that are
committed there daily. There is no divinity that can proclaim the
sacrifice of our dearest affections, the sacrifice of the family, the
sacrileges and wrongs that are committed by persons who have the name
of God on their lips. No one can require an impossibility of the
Filipino people. The noble Spanish people, so jealous of its rights and
liberties, can not bid the Filipinos renounce theirs. A people that
prides itself on the glories of its past can not ask <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb89" id="pb89" class="pginternal">89</a>]</span>another,
trained by it, to accept abjection and dishonor its own name!</p>
<p>We who today are struggling by the legal and peaceful means of
debate so understand it, and with our gaze fixed upon our ideals, shall
not cease to plead our cause, without going beyond the pale of the law,
but if violence first silences us or we have the misfortune to fall
(which is possible, for we are mortal), then we do not know what course
will be taken by the numerous tendencies that will rush in to occupy
the places that we leave vacant.</p>
<p>If what we desire is not realized....</p>
<p>In contemplating such an unfortunate eventuality, we must not turn
away in horror, and so instead of closing our eyes we will face what
the future may bring. For this purpose, after throwing the handful of
dust due to Cerberus, let us frankly descend into the abyss and sound
its terrible mysteries. <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb93" id="pb93" class="pginternal">93</a>]</span></p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main" id="xd20e764">IV.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">History does not record in its annals any lasting
domination exercised by one people over another, of different race, of
diverse usages and customs, of opposite and divergent ideals.</p>
<p>One of the two had to yield and succumb. Either the foreigner was
driven out, as happened in the case of the Carthaginians, the Moors and
the French in Spain, or else these autochthons had to give way and
perish, as was the case with the inhabitants of the New World,
Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>One of the longest dominations was that of the Moors in Spain, which
lasted seven centuries. But, even though the conquerors lived in the
country conquered, even though the Peninsula <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb94" id="pb94" class="pginternal">94</a>]</span>was
broken up into small states, which gradually emerged like little
islands in the midst of the great Saracen inundation, and in spite of
the chivalrous spirit, the gallantry and the religious toleration of
the califs, they were finally driven out after bloody and stubborn
conflicts, which formed the Spanish nation and created the Spain of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.</p>
<p>The existence of a foreign body within another endowed with strength
and activity is contrary to all natural and ethical laws. Science
teaches us that it is either assimilated, destroys the organism, is
eliminated or becomes encysted.</p>
<p>Encystment of a conquering people is impossible, for it signifies
complete isolation, absolute inertia, debility in the conquering
element. Encystment thus means the tomb of the foreign invader.</p>
<p>Now, applying these considerations to the Philippines, we must
conclude, as a deduction <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb95" id="pb95" class="pginternal">95</a>]</span>from all we have said, that if their
population be not assimilated to the Spanish nation, if the dominators
do not enter into the spirit of their inhabitants, if equable laws and
free and liberal reforms do not make each forget that they belong to
different races, or if both peoples be not amalgamated to constitute
one mass, socially and politically homogeneous, that is, not harassed
by opposing tendencies and antagonistic ideas and interests, some day
the Philippines will fatally and infallibly declare themselves
independent. To this law of destiny can be opposed neither Spanish
patriotism, nor the love of all the Filipinos for Spain, nor the
doubtful future of dismemberment and intestine strife in the Islands
themselves. Necessity is the most powerful divinity the world knows,
and necessity is the resultant of physical forces set in operation by
ethical forces.</p>
<p>We have said and statistics prove that it is impossible to
exterminate the Filipino people. <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb96" id="pb96" class="pginternal">96</a>]</span>And even were it possible, what
interest would Spain have in the destruction of the inhabitants of a
country she can not populate or cultivate, whose climate is to a
certain extent disastrous to her? What good would the Philippines be
without the Filipinos? Quite otherwise, under her colonial system and
the transitory character of the Spaniards who go to the colonies, a
colony is so much the more useful and productive to her as it possesses
inhabitants and wealth. Moreover, in order to destroy the six million
Malays, even supposing them to be in their infancy and that they have
never learned to fight and defend themselves, Spain would have to
sacrifice at least a fourth of her population. This we commend to the
notice of the partizans of colonial exploitation.</p>
<p>But nothing of this kind can happen. The menace is that when the
education and liberty necessary to human existence are denied by Spain
to the Filipinos, then they will seek <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb97" id="pb97" class="pginternal">97</a>]</span>enlightenment abroad,
behind the mother country’s back, or they will secure by hook or
by crook some advantages in their own country, with the result that the
opposition of purblind and paretic politicians will not only be futile
but even prejudicial, because it will convert motives for love and
gratitude into resentment and hatred.</p>
<p>Hatred and resentment on one side, mistrust and anger on the other,
will finally result in a violent and terrible collision, especially
when there exist elements interested in having disturbances, so that
they may get something in the excitement, demonstrate their mighty
power, foster lamentations and recriminations, or employ violent
measures. It is to be expected that the government will triumph and be
generally (as is the custom) severe in punishment, either to teach a
stern lesson in order to vaunt its strength or even to revenge upon the
vanquished the spells of excitement and terror that <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb98" id="pb98" class="pginternal">98</a>]</span>the
danger caused it. An unavoidable concomitant of those catastrophes is
the accumulation of acts of injustice committed against the innocent
and peaceful inhabitants. Private reprisals, denunciations, despicable
accusations, resentments, covetousness, the opportune moment for
calumny, the haste and hurried procedure of the courts martial, the
pretext of the integrity of the fatherland and the safety of the state,
which cloaks and justifies everything, even for scrupulous minds, which
unfortunately are still rare, and above all the panic-stricken
timidity, the cowardice that battens upon the conquered—all these
things augment the severe measures and the number of the victims. The
result is that a chasm of blood is then opened between the two peoples,
that the wounded and the afflicted, instead of becoming fewer, are
increased, for to the families and friends of the guilty, who always
think the punishment excessive and the judge unjust, must be added the
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb99" id="pb99" class="pginternal">99</a>]</span>families and friends of the innocent, who see no
advantage in living and working submissively and peacefully. Note, too,
that if severe measures are dangerous in a nation made up of a
homogeneous population, the peril is increased a hundred-fold when the
government is formed of a race different from the governed. In the
former an injustice may still be ascribed to one man alone, to a
governor actuated by personal malice, and with the death of the tyrant
the victim is reconciled to the government of his nation. But in a
country dominated by a foreign race, even the justest act of severity
is construed as injustice and oppression, because it is ordered by a
foreigner, who is unsympathetic or is an enemy of the country, and the
offense hurts not only the victim but his entire race, because it is
not usually regarded as personal, and so the resentment naturally
spreads to the whole governing race and does not die out with the
offender. <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb100" id="pb100" class="pginternal">100</a>]</span></p>
<p>Hence the great prudence and fine tact that should be exercised by
colonizing countries, and the fact that government regards the colonies
in general, and our colonial office in particular, as training schools,
contributes notably to the fulfillment of the great law that the
colonies sooner or later declare themselves independent.</p>
<p>Such is the descent down which the peoples are precipitated. In
proportion as they are bathed in blood and drenched in tears and gall,
the colony, if it has any vitality, learns how to struggle and perfect
itself in fighting, while the mother country, whose colonial life
depends upon peace and the submission of the subjects, is constantly
weakened, and, even though she make heroic efforts, as her number is
less and she has only a fictitious existence, she finally perishes. She
is like the rich voluptuary accustomed to be waited upon by a crowd of
servants toiling and planting for him, and who, on the day his slaves
refuse him obedience, as he does not live by his own efforts, must die.
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb101" id="pb101" class="pginternal">101</a>]</span></p>
<p>Reprisals, wrongs and suspicions on one part and on the other the
sentiment of patriotism and liberty, which is aroused in these
incessant conflicts, insurrections and uprisings, operate to generalize
the movement and one of the two peoples must succumb. The struggle will
be brief, for it will amount to a slavery much more cruel than death
for the people and to a dishonorable loss of prestige for the
dominator. One of the peoples must succumb.</p>
<p>Spain, from the number of her inhabitants, from the condition of her
army and navy, from the distance she is situated from the Islands, from
her scanty knowledge of them, and from struggling against a people
whose love and good will she has alienated, will necessarily have to
give way, if she does not wish to risk not only her other possessions
and her future in Africa, but also her very independence in Europe. All
this at the cost of bloodshed and crime, after mortal conflicts,
murders, conflagrations, <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb102" id="pb102" class="pginternal">102</a>]</span>military executions, famine and
misery.</p>
<p>The Spaniard is gallant and patriotic, and sacrifices everything, in
favorable moments, for his country’s good. He has the intrepidity
of his bull. The Filipino loves his country no less, and although he is
quieter, more peaceful, and with difficulty stirred up, when he is once
aroused he does not hesitate and for him the struggle means death to
one or the other combatant. He has all the meekness and all the
tenacity and ferocity of his carabao. Climate affects bipeds in the
same way that it does quadrupeds.</p>
<p>The terrible lessons and the hard teachings that these conflicts
will have afforded the Filipinos will operate to improve and strengthen
their ethical nature. The Spain of the fifteenth century was not the
Spain of the eighth. With their bitter experience, instead of intestine
conflicts of some islands against others, as is generally feared, they
will extend mutual support, <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb103" id="pb103" class="pginternal">103</a>]</span>like shipwrecked persons when they
reach an island after a fearful night of storm. Nor may it be said that
we shall partake of the fate of the small American republics. They
achieved their independence easily, and their inhabitants are animated
by a different spirit from what the Filipinos are. Besides, the danger
of falling again into other hands, English or German, for example, will
force the Filipinos to be sensible and prudent. Absence of any great
preponderance of one race over the others will free their imagination
from all mad ambitions of domination, and as the tendency of countries
that have been tyrannized over, when they once shake off the yoke, is
to adopt the freest government, like a boy leaving school, like the
beat of the pendulum, by a law of reaction the Islands will probably
declare themselves a federal republic.</p>
<p>If the Philippines secure their independence after heroic and
stubborn conflicts, they can <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb104" id="pb104" class="pginternal">104</a>]</span>rest assured that neither England,
nor Germany, nor France, and still less Holland, will dare to take up
what Spain has been unable to hold. Within a few years Africa will
completely absorb the attention of the Europeans, and there is no
sensible nation which, in order to secure a group of poor and hostile
islands, will neglect the immense territory offered by the Dark
Continent, untouched, undeveloped and almost undefended. England has
enough colonies in the Orient and is not going to risk losing her
balance. She is not going to sacrifice her Indian Empire for the poor
Philippine Islands—if she had entertained such an intention she
would not have restored Manila in 1763, but would have kept some point
in the Philippines, whence she might gradually expand. Moreover, what
need has John Bull the trader to exhaust himself for the Philippines,
when he is already lord of the Orient, when he has there Singapore,
Hongkong and Shanghai? It is <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb105" id="pb105" class="pginternal">105</a>]</span>probable that England will look
favorably upon the independence of the Philippines, for it will open
their ports to her and afford greater freedom to her commerce.
Furthermore, there exist in the United Kingdom tendencies and opinions
to the effect that she already has too many colonies, that they are
harmful, that they greatly weaken the sovereign country.</p>
<p>For the same reasons Germany will not care to run any risk, and
because a scattering of her forces and a war in distant countries will
endanger her existence on the continent. Thus we see her attitude, as
much in the Pacific as in Africa, is confined to conquering easy
territory that belongs to nobody. Germany avoids any foreign
complications.</p>
<p>France has enough to do and sees more of a future in Tongking and
China, besides the fact that the French spirit does not shine in zeal
for colonization. France loves glory, but the glory and laurels that
grow on the battlefields of <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb106" id="pb106" class="pginternal">106</a>]</span>Europe. The echo from battlefields
in the Far East hardly satisfies her craving for renown, for it reaches
her quite faintly. She has also other obligations, both internally and
on the continent.</p>
<p>Holland is sensible and will be content to keep the Moluccas and
Java. Sumatra offers her a greater future than the Philippines, whose
seas and coasts have a sinister omen for Dutch expeditions. Holland
proceeds with great caution in Sumatra and Borneo, from fear of losing
everything.</p>
<p>China will consider herself fortunate if she succeeds in keeping
herself intact and is not dismembered or partitioned among the European
powers that are colonizing the continent of Asia.</p>
<p>The same is true of Japan. On the north she has Russia, who envies
and watches her; on the south England, with whom she is in accord even
to her official language. She is, moreover, <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb107" id="pb107" class="pginternal">107</a>]</span>under such diplomatic pressure from Europe that
she can not think of outside affairs until she is freed from it, which
will not be an easy matter. True it is that she has an excess of
population, but Korea attracts her more than the Philippines and is,
also, easier to seize.</p>
<p>Perhaps the great American Republic, whose interests lie in the
Pacific and who has no hand in the spoliation of Africa, may some day
dream of foreign possession. This is not impossible, for the example is
contagious, covetousness and ambition are among the strongest vices,
and Harrison manifested something of this sort in the Samoan question.
But the Panama Canal is not opened nor the territory of the States
congested with inhabitants, and in case she should openly attempt it
the European powers would not allow her to proceed, for they know very
well that the appetite is sharpened by the first bites. North America
would be quite a troublesome rival, if she should once get into
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb108" id="pb108" class="pginternal">108</a>]</span>the business. Furthermore, this is contrary to
her traditions.</p>
<p>Very likely the Philippines will defend with inexpressible valor the
liberty secured at the price of so much blood and sacrifice. With the
new men that will spring from their soil and with the recollection of
their past, they will perhaps strive to enter freely upon the wide road
of progress, and all will labor together to strengthen their
fatherland, both internally and externally, with the same enthusiasm
with which a youth falls again to tilling the land of his ancestors, so
long wasted and abandoned through the neglect of those who have
withheld it from him. Then the mines will be made to give up their gold
for relieving distress, iron for weapons, copper, lead and coal.
Perhaps the country will revive the maritime and mercantile life for
which the islanders are fitted by their nature, ability and instincts,
and once more free, like the bird that leaves its cage, <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb109" id="pb109" class="pginternal">109</a>]</span>like
the flower that unfolds to the air, will recover the pristine virtues
that are gradually dying out and will again become addicted to
peace—cheerful, happy, joyous, hospitable and daring.</p>
<p>These and many other things may come to pass within something like a
hundred years. But the most logical prognostication, the prophecy based
on the best probabilities, may err through remote and insignificant
causes. An octopus that seized Mark Antony’s ship altered the
face of the world; a cross on Cavalry and a just man nailed thereon
changed the ethics of half the human race, and yet before Christ, how
many just men wrongfully perished and how many crosses were raised on
that hill! The death of the just sanctified his work and made his
teaching unanswerable. A sunken road at the battle of Waterloo buried
all the glories of two brilliant decades, the whole Napoleonic world,
and freed Europe. Upon what chance <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb110" id="pb110" class="pginternal">110</a>]</span>accidents will the destiny of
the Philippines depend?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is not well to trust to accident, for there is
sometimes an imperceptible and incomprehensible logic in the workings
of history. Fortunately, peoples as well as governments are subject to
it.</p>
<p>Therefore, we repeat, and we will ever repeat, while there is time,
that it is better to keep pace with the desires of a people than to
give way before them: the former begets sympathy and love, the latter
contempt and anger. Since it is necessary to grant six million
Filipinos their rights, so that they may be in fact Spaniards, let the
government grant these rights freely and spontaneously, without
damaging reservations, without irritating mistrust. We shall never tire
of repeating this while a ray of hope is left us, for we prefer this
unpleasant task to the need of some day saying to the mother country:
“Spain, we have spent our <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb111" id="pb111" class="pginternal">111</a>]</span>youth in serving thy
interests in the interests of our country; we have looked to thee, we
have expended the whole light of our intellects, all the fervor and
enthusiasm of our hearts in working for the good of what was thine, to
draw from thee a glance of love, a liberal policy that would assure us
the peace of our native land and thy sway over loyal but unfortunate
islands! Spain, thou hast remained deaf, and, wrapped up in thy pride,
hast pursued thy fatal course and accused us of being traitors, merely
because we love our country, because we tell thee the truth and hate
all kinds of injustice. What dost thou wish us to tell our wretched
country, when it asks about the result of our efforts? Must we say to
it that, since for it we have lost everything—youth, future,
hope, peace, family; since in its service we have exhausted all the
resources of hope, all the disillusions of desire, it also <span class="corr" title="Source: take" id="xd20e854">takes</span> the residue
which we can not use, the blood from our veins and <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb112" id="pb112" class="pginternal">112</a>]</span>the
strength left in our arms? Spain, must we some day tell Filipinas that
thou hast no ear for her woes and that if she wishes to be saved she
must redeem herself?” <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb115" id="pb115" class="pginternal">115</a>]</span></p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">“Countrymen: On my return from Spain I learned
that my name had been in use, among some who were in arms, as a
war-cry. The news came as a painful surprise, but, believing it already
closed, I kept silent over an incident which I considered irremediable.
Now I notice indications of the disturbances continuing, and if any
still, in good or bad faith, are availing themselves of my name, to
stop this abuse and undeceive the unwary I hasten to address you these
lines that the truth may be known.</p>
<p>“From the very beginning, when I first had notice of what was
being planned, I opposed it, and demonstrated its absolute
impossibility. This is the fact, and witnesses to my words are now
living. I was convinced that the scheme <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb116" id="pb116" class="pginternal">116</a>]</span>was utterly absurd,
and, what was worse, would bring great suffering.</p>
<p>“I did even more. When later, against my advice, the movement
materialized, of my own accord I offered not alone my good offices, but
my very life, and even my name, to be used in whatever way might seem
best, toward stifling the rebellion; for, convinced of the ills which
it would bring, I considered myself fortunate, if, at any sacrifice, I
could prevent such useless misfortunes. This equally is of record. My
countrymen, I have given proofs that I am one most anxious for
liberties for our country, and I am still desirous of them. <i>But I
place as a prior condition the education of the people</i>, that by
means of instruction and industry our country may have an individuality
of its own and make itself worthy of these liberties. I have
recommended in my writings the study of civic virtues, without which
there is no redemption. I have written likewise (and repeat my words)
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb117" id="pb117" class="pginternal">117</a>]</span>that reforms, to be beneficial, must come from
<i>above</i>, that those which come from below are irregularly gained
and uncertain.</p>
<p>“Holding these ideas, I cannot do less than condemn, and I do
condemn, this uprising,—as absurd, savage, and plotted behind my
back,—which dishonors us Filipinos and discredits those who could
plead our cause. I abhor its criminal methods and disclaim all part in
it, pitying from the bottom of my heart the unwary who have been
deceived.</p>
<p>“Return, then, to your homes, and may God pardon those who
have worked in bad faith.</p>
<p class="signed"><span class="sc">José Rizal.</span></p>
<p>“Fort Santiago, December 15th, 1896.</p>
<p>The Spanish judge-advocate-general commented upon the address:</p>
<p>“The preceding address to his countrymen which Dr. Rizal
proposes to direct to them, is not in substance the patriotic protest
against <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb118" id="pb118" class="pginternal">118</a>]</span>separatist manifestations and tendencies which
ought to come from those who claim to be loyal sons of Spain. According
to his declarations, Don José Rizal limits himself to condemning
the present insurrectionary movement as premature and because he
considers now its triumph impossible, but leaves it to be inferred that
the wished-for independence can be gained by procedures less
dishonorable than those now being followed by the rebels, when the
culture of the people shall be a most valuable asset for the combat and
guarantee its successful issue.</p>
<p>“For Rizal the question is of opportuneness, not of principles
nor of aims. His manifesto might be summarized in these words:
‘Because of my proofs of the rebellion’s certainty to fail,
lay down your arms, my countrymen. Later I shall lead you to the
Promised Land.’</p>
<p>“So far from being conducive to peace, it could advance in the
future the spirit of rebellion. For this reason the publication of
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb119" id="pb119" class="pginternal">119</a>]</span>the proposed address seems impolitic, and I
would recommend to Your Excellency to forbid its being made public, but
to order that all these papers be forwarded to the Judge Advocate
therein and added to the case against Rizal.”</p>

Rizal’s defence before the court martial which condemned him and
pretended to have tried him, on the charge of having organized

rebellion.</i></p>
<p><i>The only counsel permitted him, a young lieutenant selected from
the junior Spanish army officers, risked the displeasure of his
superiors in the few words he did say, but his argument was pitiably
weak. The court scene, where Rizal sat for hours with his elbows corded
back of him while the crowd, unrebuked by the court, clamored for his
death, recalls the stories of the bloody assizes of Judge Jeffreys and
of the bloodthirsty tribunals of the Reign of Terror. He was compelled
to testify himself, was not permitted to hear the testimony given for
the prosecution, no witness dared favor him, much less appear in his
behalf, and his own brother had been tortured, with the thumbscrews as
well as in other mediaeval and modern ways, in a vain endeavor to
extort a confession implicating the Doctor.</i> <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb125" id="pb125" class="pginternal">125</a>]</span></p>

<h3 class="main" id="xd20e923">Additions to My Defence</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Don José Rizal y Alonso respectfully requests
the Court Martial to consider well the following circumstances:</p>
<p>First.—Re the rebellion. From July 6th, 1892, I had absolutely
no connection with politics until July 1st of this year when, advised
by Don Pio Valenzuela that an uprising was proposed, I counselled
against it, trying to convince him with arguments. Don Pio Valenzuela
left me convinced apparently; so much so that instead of later taking
part in rebellion, he presented himself to the authorities for
pardon.</p>
<p>Secondly<span class="corr" title="Source: :" id="xd20e931">.</span>—A proof that I maintained no political
relation with any one, and of the falsity of the statement that I was
in the habit of sending letters by my family, is the fact that it
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb126" id="pb126" class="pginternal">126</a>]</span>was necessary to send Don Pio Valenzuela under
an assumed name, at considerable cost, when in the same steamer were
travelling five members of my family besides two servants. If what has
been charged were true, what occasion was there for Don Pio to attract
the attention of any one and incur large expenses? Besides, the mere
fact of Sr. Valenzuela’s coming to inform me of the rebellion
proves that I was not in correspondence with its promoters for if I had
been then I should have known of it, for making an uprising is a
sufficiently serious matter not to hide it from me. When they took the
step of sending Sr. Valenzuela, it proves that they were aware that I
knew nothing, that is to say, that I was not maintaining correspondence
with them. Another negative proof is that not a single letter of mine
can be shown.</p>
<p>Thirdly<span class="corr" title="Not in source" id="xd20e938">.</span>—They cruelly abused my name and at the
last hour wanted to surprise me. Why did they not communicate with me
before? <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb127" id="pb127" class="pginternal">127</a>]</span>They might say likewise that I was, if not
content, at least resigned to my fate, for I had refused various
propositions which a number of people made me to rescue me from that
place. Only in these last months, in consequence of certain domestic
affairs, having had differences with a missionary padre, I had sought
to go as a volunteer to Cuba. Don Pio Valenzuela came to warn me that I
might put myself in security, because, according to him, it was
possible that they might compromise me. As I considered myself wholly
innocent and was not posted on the details of the movement (besides
that I had convinced Sr. Valenzuela) I took no precautions, but when
His Excellency, the Governor General, wrote me announcing my departure
for Cuba, I embarked at once, leaving all my affairs unattended to. And
yet I could have gone to another part or simply have staid in Dapitan
for His Excellency’s letter was conditional. It
said—“If you persist in your idea of going to <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb128" id="pb128" class="pginternal">128</a>]</span>Cuba, etc.” When the uprising occurred it
found me on board the warship “Castilla”, and I offered
myself unconditionally to His Excellency. Twelve or <span class="corr" title="Source: fourten" id="xd20e945">fourteen</span> days later I set
out for Europe, and had I had an uneasy conscience I should have tried
to escape in some port en route, especially Singapore, where I went
ashore and when other passengers who had passports for Spain staid
over. I had an easy conscience and hoped to go to Cuba.</p>
<p>Fourthly.—In Dapitan I had boats and I was permitted to make
excursions along the coast and to the settlements, absences which
lasted as long as I wished, at times a week. If I had still had
intentions of political activity, I might have gotten away even in the
vintas of the Moros whom I knew in the settlements. Neither would I
have built my small hospital nor bought land nor invited my family to
live with me.</p>
<p>Fifthly.—Some one has said that I was the chief. What kind of
a chief is he who is ignored <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb129" id="pb129" class="pginternal">129</a>]</span>in the plotting and who is
notified only that he may escape? How is he chief who when he says no,
they say yes?</p>
<p>—As to the “Liga”:</p>
<p>Sixthly.—It is true that I drafted its By-Laws whose aims were
to promote commerce, industry, the arts, etc<span class="corr" title="Not in source" id="xd20e958">.</span>, by means of united action,
as have testified witnesses not at all prejudiced in my favor, rather
the reverse.</p>
<p>Seventhly<span class="corr" title="Not in source" id="xd20e963">.</span>—The “Liga” never came into
real existence nor ever got to working, since after the first meeting
no one paid any attention to it, because I was exiled a few days
later.</p>
<p>Eighthly.—If it was reorganized nine months afterwards by
other persons, as now is said, I was ignorant of the fact.</p>
<p>Ninthly.—The “Liga” was not a society with harmful
tendencies and the proof is the fact that the radicals had to leave it,
organizing the Katipunan which was what answered their purposes. Had
the “Liga” lacked only a little of <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb130" id="pb130" class="pginternal">130</a>]</span>being adapted for rebellion, the radicals would
not have left it but simply would have modified it; besides, if, as
some allege, I am the chief, out of consideration for me and for the
prestige of my name, they would have retained the name of
“Liga”. Their having abandoned it, name and all, proves
clearly that they neither counted on me nor did the “Liga”
serve their purposes, otherwise they would not have made another
society when they had one already organized.</p>
<p>Tenthly.—As to my letters, I beg of the court that, if there
are any bitter criticisms in them, it will consider the circumstances
under which they were written. Then we had been deprived of our two
dwellings, warehouses, lands, and besides all my brothers-in-law and my
brother were deported, in consequence of a suit arising from an inquiry
of the Administracion de Hacienda (tax-collecting branch of the
government), a case in which, according to our attorney (in
<span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb131" id="pb131" class="pginternal">131</a>]</span>Madrid), Sr. Linares Rivas, we had the right on
our side.</p>
<p>Eleventhly.—That I have endured exile without complaint, not
because of the charge alleged, for that was not true, but for what I
had been able to write. And ask the politico-military commanders of the
district where I resided of my conduct during these four years of
exile, of the town, even of the very missionary parish priests despite
my personal differences with one of them.</p>
<p>Twelfthly.—All these facts and considerations destroy the
little-founded accusation of those who have testified against me, with
whom I have asked the Judge to be confronted. Is it possible that in a
single night I was able to line up all the filibusterism, at a
gathering which discussed commerce, etc., a gathering which went no
further for it died immediately afterwards? If the few who were present
had been influenced by my words they would not have <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb132" id="pb132" class="pginternal">132</a>]</span>let
the “Liga” die. Is it that those who formed part of the
“Liga” that night founded the Katipunan? I think not. Who
went to Dapitan to interview me? Persons entirely unknown to me. Why
was not an acquaintance sent, in whom I would have had more confidence?
Because those acquainted with me knew very well that I had forsaken
politics or that, realizing my views on rebellion, they must have
refused to undertake a mission useless and unpromising.</p>
<p>I trust that by these considerations I have demonstrated that
neither did I found a society for revolutionary purposes, nor have I
taken part since in others, nor have I been concerned in the rebellion,
but that on the contrary I have been opposed to it, as the making
public of a private conversation has proven.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I had no notice at all of what was being planned until
the first or second of July, in 1896, when Pio Valenzuela came to see
me, saying that an uprising was being arranged. I told him that it was
absurd, etc., etc. and he answered me that they could bear no more. I
advised him that they should have patience, etc., etc. He added then
that he had been sent because they had compassion of my life and that
probably it would compromise me. I replied that they should have
patience and that if anything happened to me I would then prove my
innocence. “Besides, said I, don’t consider me but our
country which is the one that will suffer.” I went on to show how
absurd was the movement.—This later Pio Valenzuela
testified.—He did not tell me that my name was <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb135" id="pb135" class="pginternal">135</a>]</span>being used, neither did he suggest that I was
its chief, nor anything of that sort.</p>
<p>Those who testify that I am the chief (which I do not know nor do I
know of having ever treated with them), what proofs do they present of
my having accepted this chiefship or that I was in relations with them
or with their society? Either they have made use of my name for their
own purposes or they have been deceived by others who have. Where is
the chief who dictates no order nor makes any arrangement, who is not
consulted in any way about so important an enterprise until the last
moment, and then, when he decides against it, is disobeyed? Since the
seventh of July of 1892 I have entirely ceased political activity. It
seems some have wished to avail themselves of my name for their own
ends. <span class="pagenum">[<a href="#pb136" id="pb136" class="pginternal">136</a>]</span></p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work

Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>


<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works

    <div style="text-indent:-0.7em">
        • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of

agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
