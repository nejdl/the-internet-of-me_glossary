</p><h4>TO<br>
  MY FRIEND<br>
  E. LE GRAND BEERS</h4>
<div class="block1"><p><span class="sc">My dear Le Grand,</span>—You and I were early drawn
  together by a common love of nature. Your researches into the
  natural history of the tree-toad, your observations upon the
  mud-turtles of Providence Township, your experiments with the
  fresh-water lobster, all stimulated my enthusiasm in a
  scientific direction, which has crystallized in this helpful
  little book, dedicated to you.</p>
  <p>Pray accept it as an insignificant payment on account for all
    I owe to you.</p>

</p><h3>PREFACE</h3>
<p><br>
</p><p>It appears to the writer that there is urgent need of more "nature
  books"—books that are scraped clear of fiction and which display only
  the carefully articulated skeleton of fact. Hence this little volume,
  presented with some hesitation and more modesty. Various chapters
  have, at intervals, appeared in the pages of various publications. The
  continued narrative is now published for the first time; and the
  writer trusts that it may inspire enthusiasm for natural and
  scientific research, and inculcate a passion for accurate observation
  among the young.</p>

</p><h2>IN SEARCH OF THE UNKNOWN</h2>
<p><br>
</p><h3>I<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc" class="pginternal">ToC</a></span></h3>
<p><br>
</p><p>Because it all seems so improbable—so horribly impossible to me now,
  sitting here safe and sane in my own library—I hesitate to record an
  episode which already appears to me less horrible than grotesque. Yet,
  unless this story is written now, I know I shall never have the
  courage to tell the truth about the matter—not from fear of ridicule,
  but because I myself shall soon cease to credit what I now know to be
  true. Yet scarcely a month has elapsed since I heard the stealthy
  purring of what I believed to be the shoaling undertow—scarcely a
  month ago, with my own eyes, I saw that which, even now, I am
  beginning to believe never existed. As for the harbor-master—and the
  blow I am now striking at the old order of things—But of that I shall
  not speak now, or later; I shall try to tell the story simply and
  truthfully, and let my friends testify as to my probity and the
  publishers of this book corroborate them.</p>
<p>On the 29th of February I resigned my position under the government
  and left Washington to accept an offer from Professor Farrago—whose
  name he kindly <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>permits me to use—and on the first day of April I
  entered upon my new and congenial duties as general superintendent of
  the water-fowl department connected with the Zoological Gardens then
  in course of erection at Bronx Park, New York.</p>
<p>For a week I followed the routine, examining the new foundations,
  studying the architect's plans, following the surveyors through the
  Bronx thickets, suggesting arrangements for water-courses and pools
  destined to be included in the enclosures for swans, geese, pelicans,
  herons, and such of the waders and swimmers as we might expect to
  acclimate in Bronx Park.</p>
<p>It was at that time the policy of the trustees and officers of the
  Zoological Gardens neither to employ collectors nor to send out
  expeditions in search of specimens. The society decided to depend upon
  voluntary contributions, and I was always busy, part of the day, in
  dictating answers to correspondents who wrote offering their services
  as hunters of big game, collectors of all sorts of fauna, trappers,
  snarers, and also to those who offered specimens for sale, usually at
  exorbitant rates.</p>
<p>To the proprietors of five-legged kittens, mangy lynxes, moth-eaten
  coyotes, and dancing bears I returned courteous but uncompromising
  refusals—of course, first submitting all such letters, together with
  my replies, to Professor Farrago.</p>
<p>One day towards the end of May, however, just as I was leaving Bronx
  Park to return to town, Professor Lesard, of the reptilian department,
  called out to me that Professor Farrago wanted to see me a moment; so
  I put my pipe into my pocket again and retraced my steps to the
  temporary, wooden building occupied by <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>Professor Farrago, general
  superintendent of the Zoological Gardens. The professor, who was
  sitting at his desk before a pile of letters and replies submitted for
  approval by me, pushed his glasses down and looked over them at me
  with a whimsical smile that suggested amusement, impatience,
  annoyance, and perhaps a faint trace of apology.</p>
<p>"Now, here's a letter," he said, with a deliberate gesture towards a
  sheet of paper impaled on a file—"a letter that I suppose you
  remember." He disengaged the sheet of paper and handed it to me.</p>
<p>"Oh yes," I replied, with a shrug; "of course the man is
  mistaken—or—"</p>
<p>"Or what?" demanded Professor Farrago, tranquilly, wiping his glasses.</p>
<p>"—Or a liar," I replied.</p>
<p>After a silence he leaned back in his chair and bade me read the
  letter to him again, and I did so with a contemptuous tolerance for
  the writer, who must have been either a very innocent victim or a very
  stupid swindler. I said as much to Professor Farrago, but, to my
  surprise, he appeared to waver.</p>
<p>"I suppose," he said, with his near-sighted, embarrassed smile, "that
  nine hundred and ninety-nine men in a thousand would throw that letter
  aside and condemn the writer as a liar or a fool?"</p>
<p>"In my opinion," said I, "he's one or the other."</p>
<p>"He isn't—in mine," said the professor, placidly.</p>
<p>"What!" I exclaimed. "Here is a man living all alone on a strip of
  rock and sand between the wilderness and the sea, who wants you to
  send somebody to take charge of a bird that doesn't exist!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>"How do you know," asked Professor Farrago, "that the bird in question
  does not exist?"</p>
<p>"It is generally accepted," I replied, sarcastically, "that the great
  auk has been extinct for years. Therefore I may be pardoned for
  doubting that our correspondent possesses a pair of them alive."</p>
<p>"Oh, you young fellows," said the professor, smiling wearily, "you
  embark on a theory for destinations that don't exist."</p>
<p>He leaned back in his chair, his amused eyes searching space for the
  imagery that made him smile.</p>
<p>"Like swimming squirrels, you navigate with the help of Heaven and a
  stiff breeze, but you never land where you hope to—do you?"</p>
<p>Rather red in the face, I said: "Don't you believe the great auk to be
  extinct?"</p>
<p>"Audubon saw the great auk."</p>
<p>"Who has seen a single specimen since?"</p>
<p>"Nobody—except our correspondent here," he replied, laughing.</p>
<p>I laughed, too, considering the interview at an end, but the professor
  went on, coolly:</p>
<p>"Whatever it is that our correspondent has—and I am daring to believe
  that it <i>is</i> the great auk itself—I want you to secure it for the
  society."</p>
<p>When my astonishment subsided my first conscious sentiment was one of
  pity. Clearly, Professor Farrago was on the verge of dotage—ah, what
  a loss to the world!</p>
<p>I believe now that Professor Farrago perfectly interpreted my
  thoughts, but he betrayed neither resentment nor impatience. I drew a
  chair up beside his <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>desk—there was nothing to do but to obey, and
  this fool's errand was none of my conceiving.</p>
<p>Together we made out a list of articles necessary for me and itemized
  the expenses I might incur, and I set a date for my return, allowing
  no margin for a successful termination to the expedition.</p>
<p>"Never mind that," said the professor. "What I want you to do is to
  get those birds here safely. Now, how many men will you take?"</p>
<p>"None," I replied, bluntly; "it's a useless expense, unless there is
  something to bring back. If there is I'll wire you, you may be sure."</p>
<p>"Very well," said Professor Farrago, good-humoredly, "you shall have
  all the assistance you may require. Can you leave to-night?"</p>
<p>The old gentleman was certainly prompt. I nodded, half-sulkily, aware
  of his amusement.</p>
<p>"So," I said, picking up my hat, "I am to start north to find a place
  called Black Harbor, where there is a man named Halyard who possesses,
  among other household utensils, two extinct great auks—"</p>
<p>We were both laughing by this time. I asked him why on earth he
  credited the assertion of a man he had never before heard of.</p>
<p>"I suppose," he replied, with the same half-apologetic, half-humorous
  smile, "it is instinct. I feel, somehow, that this man Halyard <i>has</i>
  got an auk—perhaps two. I can't get away from the idea that we are on
  the eve of acquiring the rarest of living creatures. It's odd for a
  scientist to talk as I do; doubtless you're shocked—admit it, now!"</p>
<p>But I was not shocked; on the contrary, I was <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>conscious that the same
  strange hope that Professor Farrago cherished was beginning, in spite
  of me, to stir my pulses, too.</p>
<p>"If he has—" I began, then stopped.</p>
<p>The professor and I looked hard at each other in silence.</p>
<p>"Go on," he said, encouragingly.</p>
<p>But I had nothing more to say, for the prospect of beholding with my
  own eyes a living specimen of the great auk produced a series of
  conflicting emotions within me which rendered speech profanely
  superfluous.</p>
<p>As I took my leave Professor Farrago came to the door of the
  temporary, wooden office and handed me the letter written by the man
  Halyard. I folded it and put it into my pocket, as Halyard might
  require it for my own identification.</p>
<p>"How much does he want for the pair?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Ten thousand dollars. Don't demur—if the birds are really—"</p>
<p>"I know," I said, hastily, not daring to hope too much.</p>
<p>"One thing more," said Professor Farrago, gravely; "you know, in that
  last paragraph of his letter, Halyard speaks of something else in the
  way of specimens—an undiscovered species of amphibious biped—just
  read that paragraph again, will you?"</p>
<p>I drew the letter from my pocket and read as he directed:</p>
<div class="block2"><p>"When you have seen the two living specimens of the great auk,
  and have satisfied yourself that I tell the truth, you may be
  wise enough to listen without prejudice to a statement I shall
  make concerning the existence of the strangest creature ever
  fashioned. I will merely say, at this time, that the creature
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>referred to is an amphibious biped and inhabits the ocean near
  this coast. More I cannot say, for I personally have not seen
  the animal, but I have a witness who has, and there are many
  who affirm that they have seen the creature. You will
  naturally say that my statement amounts to nothing; but when
  your representative arrives, if he be free from prejudice, I
  expect his reports to you concerning this sea-biped will
  confirm the solemn statements of a witness I <i>know</i> to be
  unimpeachable.</p>
  <p class="right">"Yours truly,          <span class="sc">Burton Halyard.</span></p>
  <p class="sc">"Black Harbor."</p>
</div>
<p>"Well," I said, after a moment's thought, "here goes for the
  wild-goose chase."</p>
<p>"Wild auk, you mean," said Professor Farrago, shaking hands with me.
  "You will start to-night, won't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but Heaven knows how I'm ever going to land in this man
  Halyard's door-yard. Good-bye!"</p>
<p>"About that sea-biped—" began Professor Farrago, shyly.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't!" I said; "I can swallow the auks, feathers and claws, but
  if this fellow Halyard is hinting he's seen an amphibious creature
  resembling a man—"</p>
<p>"—Or a woman," said the professor, cautiously.</p>
<p>I retired, disgusted, my faith shaken in the mental vigor of Professor
  Farrago.</p>

</p><h3>II<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc" class="pginternal">ToC</a></span></h3>
<p><br>
</p><p>The three days' voyage by boat and rail was irksome. I bought my kit
  at Sainte Croix, on the Central Pacific Railroad, and on June 1st I
  began the last stage of my journey <i>via</i> the Sainte Isole broad-gauge,
  arriving in the wilderness by daylight. A tedious forced march by
  blazed trail, freshly spotted on the wrong side, of course, brought me
  to the northern terminus of the rusty, narrow-gauge lumber railway
  which runs from the heart of the hushed pine wilderness to the sea.</p>
<p>Already a long train of battered flat-cars, piled with sluice-props
  and roughly hewn sleepers, was moving slowly off into the brooding
  forest gloom, when I came in sight of the track; but I developed a
  gratifying and unexpected burst of speed, shouting all the while. The
  train stopped; I swung myself aboard the last car, where a pleasant
  young fellow was sitting on the rear brake, chewing spruce and reading
  a letter.</p>
<p>"Come aboard, sir," he said, looking up with a smile; "I guess you're
  the man in a hurry."</p>
<p>"I'm looking for a man named Halyard," I said, dropping rifle and
  knapsack on the fresh-cut, fragrant pile of pine. "Are you Halyard?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm Francis Lee, bossing the mica pit at Port-of-Waves," he
  replied, "but this letter is from Halyard, asking me to look out for a
  man in a hurry from Bronx Park, New York."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>"I'm that man," said I, filling my pipe and offering him a share of
  the weed of peace, and we sat side by side smoking very amiably, until
  a signal from the locomotive sent him forward and I was left alone,
  lounging at ease, head pillowed on both arms, watching the blue sky
  flying through the branches overhead.</p>
<p>Long before we came in sight of the ocean I smelled it; the fresh,
  salt aroma stole into my senses, drowsy with the heated odor of pine
  and hemlock, and I sat up, peering ahead into the dusky sea of pines.</p>
<p>Fresher and fresher came the wind from the sea, in puffs, in mild,
  sweet breezes, in steady, freshening currents, blowing the feathery
  crowns of the pines, setting the balsam's blue tufts rocking.</p>
<p>Lee wandered back over the long line of flats, balancing himself
  nonchalantly as the cars swung around a sharp curve, where water
  dripped from a newly propped sluice that suddenly emerged from the
  depths of the forest to run parallel to the railroad track.</p>
<p>"Built it this spring," he said, surveying his handiwork, which seemed
  to undulate as the cars swept past. "It runs to the cove—or ought
  to—" He stopped abruptly with a thoughtful glance at me.</p>
<p>"So you're going over to Halyard's?" he continued, as though answering
  a question asked by himself.</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>"You've never been there—of course?"</p>
<p>"No," I said, "and I'm not likely to go again."</p>
<p>I would have told him why I was going if I had not already begun to
  feel ashamed of my idiotic errand.</p>
<p>"I guess you're going to look at those birds of his," continued Lee,
  placidly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>"I guess I am," I said, sulkily, glancing askance to see whether he
  was smiling.</p>
<p>But he only asked me, quite seriously, whether a great auk was really
  a very rare bird; and I told him that the last one ever seen had been
  found dead off Labrador in January, 1870. Then I asked him whether
  these birds of Halyard's were really great auks, and he replied,
  somewhat indifferently, that he supposed they were—at least, nobody
  had ever before seen such birds near Port-of-Waves.</p>
<p>"There's something else," he said, running, a pine-sliver through his
  pipe-stem—"something that interests us all here more than auks, big
  or little. I suppose I might as well speak of it, as you are bound to
  hear about it sooner or later."</p>
<p>He hesitated, and I could see that he was embarrassed, searching for
  the exact words to convey his meaning.</p>
<p>"If," said I, "you have anything in this region more important to
  science than the great auk, I should be very glad to know about it."</p>
<p>Perhaps there was the faintest tinge of sarcasm in my voice, for he
  shot a sharp glance at me and then turned slightly. After a moment,
  however, he put his pipe into his pocket, laid hold of the brake with
  both hands, vaulted to his perch aloft, and glanced down at me.</p>
<p>"Did you ever hear of the harbor-master?" he asked, maliciously.</p>
<p>"Which harbor-master?" I inquired.</p>
<p>"You'll know before long," he observed, with a satisfied glance into
  perspective.</p>
<p>This rather extraordinary observation puzzled me. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>I waited for him to
  resume, and, as he did not, I asked him what he meant.</p>
<p>"If I knew," he said, "I'd tell you. But, come to think of it, I'd be
  a fool to go into details with a scientific man. You'll hear about the
  harbor-master—perhaps you will see the harbor-master. In that event I
  should be glad to converse with you on the subject."</p>
<p>I could not help laughing at his prim and precise manner, and, after a
  moment, he also laughed, saying:</p>
<p>"It hurts a man's vanity to know he knows a thing that somebody else
  knows he doesn't know. I'm damned if I say another word about the
  harbor-master until you've been to Halyard's!"</p>
<p>"A harbor-master," I persisted, "is an official who superintends the
  mooring of ships—isn't he?"</p>
<p>But he refused to be tempted into conversation, and we lounged
  silently on the lumber until a long, thin whistle from the locomotive
  and a rush of stinging salt-wind brought us to our feet. Through the
  trees I could see the bluish-black ocean, stretching out beyond black
  headlands to meet the clouds; a great wind was roaring among the trees
  as the train slowly came to a stand-still on the edge of the primeval
  forest.</p>
<p>Lee jumped to the ground and aided me with my rifle and pack, and then
  the train began to back away along a curved side-track which, Lee
  said, led to the mica-pit and company stores.</p>
<p>"Now what will you do?" he asked, pleasantly. "I can give you a good
  dinner and a decent bed to-night if you like—and I'm sure Mrs. Lee
  would be very glad to have you stop with us as long as you choose."</p>
<p>I thanked him, but said that I was anxious to reach <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>Halyard's before
  dark, and he very kindly led me along the cliffs and pointed out the
  path.</p>
<p>"This man Halyard," he said, "is an invalid. He lives at a cove called
  Black Harbor, and all his truck goes through to him over the company's
  road. We receive it here, and send a pack-mule through once a month.
  I've met him; he's a bad-tempered hypochondriac, a cynic at heart, and
  a man whose word is never doubted. If he says he has a great auk, you
  may be satisfied he has."</p>
<p>My heart was beating with excitement at the prospect; I looked out
  across the wooded headlands and tangled stretches of dune and hollow,
  trying to realize what it might mean to me, to Professor Farrago, to
  the world, if I should lead back to New York a live auk.</p>
<p>"He's a crank," said Lee; "frankly, I don't like him. If you find it
  unpleasant there, come back to us."</p>
<p>"Does Halyard live alone?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Yes—except for a professional trained nurse—poor thing!"</p>
<p>"A man?"</p>
<p>"No," said Lee, disgustedly.</p>
<p>Presently he gave me a peculiar glance; hesitated, and finally said:
  "Ask Halyard to tell you about his nurse and—the harbor-master.
  Good-bye—I'm due at the quarry. Come and stay with us whenever you
  care to; you will find a welcome at Port-of-Waves."</p>
<p>We shook hands and parted on the cliff, he turning back into the
  forest along the railway, I starting northward, pack slung, rifle over
  my shoulder. Once I met a group of quarrymen, faces burned brick-red,
  scarred <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>hands swinging as they walked. And, as I passed them with a
  nod, turning, I saw that they also had turned to look after me, and I
  caught a word or two of their conversation, whirled back to me on the
  sea-wind.</p>
<p>They were speaking of the harbor-master.</p>

</p><h3>III<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc" class="pginternal">ToC</a></span></h3>
<p><br>
</p><p>Towards sunset I came out on a sheer granite cliff where the sea-birds
  were whirling and clamoring, and the great breakers dashed, rolling in
  double-thundered reverberations on the sun-dyed, crimson sands below
  the rock.</p>
<p>Across the half-moon of beach towered another cliff, and, behind this,
  I saw a column of smoke rising in the still air. It certainly came
  from Halyard's chimney, although the opposite cliff prevented me from
  seeing the house itself.</p>
<p>I rested a moment to refill my pipe, then resumed rifle and pack, and
  cautiously started to skirt the cliffs. I had descended half-way
  towards the beech, and was examining the cliff opposite, when
  something on the very top of the rock arrested my attention—a man
  darkly outlined against the sky. The next moment, however, I knew it
  could not be a man, for the object suddenly glided over the face of
  the cliff and slid down the sheer, smooth lace like a lizard. Before I
  could get a square look at it, the thing crawled into the surf—or, at
  least, it seemed to—but the whole episode occurred so suddenly, so
  unexpectedly, that I was not sure I had seen anything at all.</p>
<p>However, I was curious enough to climb the cliff on the land side and
  make my way towards the spot where <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>I imagined I saw the man. Of
  course, there was nothing there—not a trace of a human being, I mean.
  Something <i>had</i> been there—a sea-otter, possibly—for the remains of
  a freshly killed fish lay on the rock, eaten to the back-bone and
  tail.</p>
<p>The next moment, below me, I saw the house, a freshly painted, trim,
  flimsy structure, modern, and very much out of harmony with the
  splendid savagery surrounding it. It struck a nasty, cheap note in the
  noble, gray monotony of headland and sea.</p>
<p>The descent was easy enough. I crossed the crescent beach, hard as
  pink marble, and found a little trodden path among the rocks, that led
  to the front porch of the house.</p>
<p>There were two people on the porch—I heard their voices before I saw
  them—and when I set my foot upon the wooden steps, I saw one of them,
  a woman, rise from her chair and step hastily towards me.</p>
<p>"Come back!" cried the other, a man with a smooth-shaven, deeply lined
  face, and a pair of angry, blue eyes; and the woman stepped back
  quietly, acknowledging my lifted hat with a silent inclination.</p>
<p>The man, who was reclining in an invalid's rolling-chair, clapped both
  large, pale hands to the wheels and pushed himself out along the
  porch. He had shawls pinned about him, an untidy, drab-colored hat on
  his head, and, when he looked down at me, he scowled.</p>
<p>"I know who you are," he said, in his acid voice; "you're one of the
  Zoological men from Bronx Park. You look like it, anyway."</p>
<p>"It is easy to recognize you from your reputation," I replied,
  irritated at his discourtesy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>"Really," he replied, with something between a sneer and a laugh, "I'm
  obliged for your frankness. You're after my great auks, are you not?"</p>
<p>"Nothing else would have tempted me into this place," I replied,
  sincerely.</p>
<p>"Thank Heaven for that," he said. "Sit down a moment; you've
  interrupted us." Then, turning to the young woman, who wore the neat
  gown and tiny cap of a professional nurse, he bade her resume what she
  had been saying. She did so, with deprecating glance at me, which made
  the old man sneer again.</p>
<p>"It happened so suddenly," she said, in her low voice, "that I had no
  chance to get back. The boat was drifting in the cove; I sat in the
  stern, reading, both oars shipped, and the tiller swinging. Then I
  heard a scratching under the boat, but thought it might be
  sea-weed—and, next moment, came those soft thumpings, like the sound
  of a big fish rubbing its nose against a float."</p>
<p>Halyard clutched the wheels of his chair and stared at the girl in
  grim displeasure.</p>
<p>"Didn't you know enough to be frightened?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"No—not then," she said, coloring faintly; "but when, after a few
  moments, I looked up and saw the harbor-master running up and down the
  beach, I was horribly frightened."</p>
<p>"Really?" said Halyard, sarcastically; "it was about time." Then,
  turning to me, he rasped out: "And that young lady was obliged to row
  all the way to Port-of-Waves and call to Lee's quarrymen to take her
  boat in."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>Completely mystified, I looked from Halyard to the girl, not in the
  least comprehending what all this meant.</p>
<p>"That will do," said Halyard, ungraciously, which curt phrase was
  apparently the usual dismissal for the nurse.</p>
<p>She rose, and I rose, and she passed me with an inclination, stepping
  noiselessly into the house.</p>
<p>"I want beef-tea!" bawled Halyard after her; then he gave me an
  unamiable glance.</p>
<p>"I was a well-bred man," he sneered; "I'm a Harvard graduate, too, but
  I live as I like, and I do what I like, and I say what I like."</p>
<p>"You certainly are not reticent," I said, disgusted.</p>
<p>"Why should I be?" he rasped; "I pay that young woman for my
  irritability; it's a bargain between us."</p>
<p>"In your domestic affairs," I said, "there is nothing that interests
  me. I came to see those auks."</p>
<p>"You probably believe them to be razor-billed auks," he said,
  contemptuously. "But they're not; they're great auks."</p>
<p>I suggested that he permit me to examine them, and he replied,
  indifferently, that they were in a pen in his backyard, and that I was
  free to step around the house when I cared to.</p>
<p>I laid my rifle and pack on the veranda, and hastened off with mixed
  emotions, among which hope no longer predominated. No man in his
  senses would keep two such precious prizes in a pen in his backyard, I
  argued, and I was perfectly prepared to find anything from a puffin to
  a penguin in that pen.</p>
<p>I shall never forget, as long as I live, my stupor of amazement when I
  came to the wire-covered enclosure. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>Not only were there two great
  auks in the pen, alive, breathing, squatting in bulky majesty on their
  sea-weed bed, but one of them was gravely contemplating two newly
  hatched chicks, all bill and feet, which nestled sedately at the edge
  of a puddle of salt-water, where some small fish were swimming.</p>
<p>For a while excitement blinded, nay, deafened me. I tried to realize
  that I was gazing upon the last individuals of an all but extinct
  race—the sole survivors of the gigantic auk, which, for thirty years,
  has been accounted an extinct creature.</p>
<p>I believe that I did not move muscle nor limb until the sun had gone
  down and the crowding darkness blurred my straining eyes and blotted
  the great, silent, bright-eyed birds from sight.</p>
<p>Even then I could not tear myself away from the enclosure; I listened
  to the strange, drowsy note of the male bird, the fainter responses of
  the female, the thin plaints of the chicks, huddling under her breast;
  I heard their flipper-like, embryotic wings beating sleepily as the
  birds stretched and yawned their beaks and clacked them, preparing for
  slumber.</p>
<p>"If you please," came a soft voice from the door, "Mr. Halyard awaits
  your company to dinner."</p>
<p><br>
</p><p><br>
</p><p><br>
</p><p><br>
</p><p><a id="IV"></a></p><hr>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p><p><br>
</p><h3>IV<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc" class="pginternal">ToC</a></span></h3>
<p><br>
</p><p>I dined well—or, rather, I might have enjoyed my dinner if Mr.
  Halyard had been eliminated; and the feast consisted exclusively of a
  joint of beef, the pretty nurse, and myself. She was exceedingly
  attractive—with a disturbing fashion of lowering her head and raising
  her dark eyes when spoken to.</p>
<p>As for Halyard, he was unspeakable, bundled up in his snuffy shawls,
  and making uncouth noises over his gruel. But it is only just to say
  that his table was worth sitting down to and his wine was sound as a
  bell.</p>
<p>"Yah!" he snapped, "I'm sick of this cursed soup—and I'll trouble you
  to fill my glass—"</p>
<p>"It is dangerous for you to touch claret," said the pretty nurse.</p>
<p>"I might as well die at dinner as anywhere," he observed.</p>
<p>"Certainly," said I, cheerfully passing the decanter, but he did not
  appear overpleased with the attention.</p>
<p>"I can't smoke, either," he snarled, hitching the shawls around until
  he looked like Richard the Third.</p>
<p>However, he was good enough to shove a box of cigars at me, and I took
  one and stood up, as the pretty nurse slipped past and vanished into
  the little parlor beyond.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>We sat there for a while without speaking. He picked irritably at the
  bread-crumbs on the cloth, never glancing in my direction; and I,
  tired from my long foot-tour, lay back in my chair, silently
  appreciating one of the best cigars I ever smoked.</p>
<p>"Well," he rasped out at length, "what do you think of my auks—and my
  veracity?"</p>
<p>I told him that both were unimpeachable.</p>
<p>"Didn't they call me a swindler down there at your museum?" he
  demanded.</p>
<p>I admitted that I had heard the term applied. Then I made a clean
  breast of the matter, telling him that it was I who had doubted; that
  my chief, Professor Farrago, had sent me against my will, and that I
  was ready and glad to admit that he, Mr. Halyard, was a benefactor of
  the human race.</p>
<p>"Bosh!" he said. "What good does a confounded wobbly, bandy-toed bird
  do to the human race?"</p>
<p>But he was pleased, nevertheless; and presently he asked me, not
  unamiably, to punish his claret again.</p>
<p>"I'm done for," he said; "good things to eat and drink are no good to
  me. Some day I'll get mad enough to have a fit, and then—"</p>
<p>He paused to yawn.</p>
<p>"Then," he continued, "that little nurse of mine will drink up my
  claret and go back to civilization, where people are polite."</p>
<p>Somehow or other, in spite of the fact that Halyard was an old pig,
  what he said touched me. There was certainly not much left in life for
  him—as he regarded life.</p>
<p>"I'm going to leave her this house," he said, arranging <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>his shawls.
  "She doesn't know it. I'm going to leave her my money, too. She
  doesn't know that. Good Lord! What kind of a woman can she be to stand
  my bad temper for a few dollars a month!"</p>
<p>"I think," said I, "that it's partly because she's poor, partly
  because she's sorry for you."</p>
<p>He looked up with a ghastly smile.</p>
<p>"You think she really is sorry?"</p>
<p>Before I could answer he went on: "I'm no mawkish sentimentalist, and
  I won't allow anybody to be sorry for me—do you hear?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm not sorry for you!" I said, hastily, and, for the first time
  since I had seen him, he laughed heartily, without a sneer.</p>
<p>We both seemed to feel better after that; I drank his wine and smoked
  his cigars, and he appeared to take a certain grim pleasure in
  watching me.</p>
<p>"There's no fool like a young fool," he observed, presently.</p>
<p>As I had no doubt he referred to me, I paid him no attention.</p>
<p>After fidgeting with his shawls, he gave me an oblique scowl and asked
  me my age.</p>
<p>"Twenty-four," I replied.</p>
<p>"Sort of a tadpole, aren't you?" he said.</p>
<p>As I took no offence, he repeated the remark.</p>
<p>"Oh, come," said I, "there's no use in trying to irritate me. I see
  through you; a row acts like a cocktail on you—but you'll have to
  stick to gruel in my company."</p>
<p>"I call that impudence!" he rasped out, wrathfully.</p>
<p>"I don't care what you call it," I replied, undisturbed, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>"I am not
  going to be worried by you. Anyway," I ended, "it is my opinion that
  you could be very good company if you chose."</p>
<p>The proposition appeared to take his breath away—at least, he said
  nothing more; and I finished my cigar in peace and tossed the stump
  into a saucer.</p>
<p>"Now," said I, "what price do you set upon your birds, Mr. Halyard?"</p>
<p>"Ten thousand dollars," he snapped, with an evil smile.</p>
<p>"You will receive a certified check when the birds are delivered," I
  said, quietly.</p>
<p>"You don't mean to say you agree to that outrageous bargain—and I
  won't take a cent less, either—Good Lord!—haven't you any spirit
  left?" he cried, half rising from his pile of shawls.</p>
<p>His piteous eagerness for a dispute sent me into laughter impossible
  to control, and he eyed me, mouth open, animosity rising visibly.</p>
<p>Then he seized the wheels of his invalid chair and trundled away, too
  mad to speak; and I strolled out into the parlor, still laughing.</p>
<p>The pretty nurse was there, sewing under a hanging lamp.</p>
<p>"If I am not indiscreet—" I began.</p>
<p>"Indiscretion is the better part of valor," said she, dropping her
  head but raising her eyes.</p>
<p>So I sat down with a frivolous smile peculiar to the appreciated.</p>
<p>"Doubtless," said I, "you are hemming a 'kerchief."</p>
<p>"Doubtless I am not," she said; "this is a night-cap for Mr.
  Halyard."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>A mental vision of Halyard in a night-cap, very mad, nearly set me
  laughing again.</p>
<p>"Like the King of Yvetot, he wears his crown in bed," I said,
  flippantly.</p>
<p>"The King of Yvetot might have made that remark," she observed,
  re-threading her needle.</p>
<p>It is unpleasant to be reproved. How large and red and hot a man's
  ears feel.</p>
<p>To cool them, I strolled out to the porch; and, after a while, the
  pretty nurse came out, too, and sat down in a chair not far away. She
  probably regretted her lost opportunity to be flirted with.</p>
<p>"I have so little company—it is a great relief to see somebody from
  the world," she said. "If you can be agreeable, I wish you would."</p>
<p>The idea that she had come out to see me was so agreeable that I
  remained speechless until she said: "Do tell me what people are doing
  in New York."</p>
<p>So I seated myself on the steps and talked about the portion of the
  world inhabited by me, while she sat sewing in the dull light that
  straggled out from the parlor windows.</p>
<p>She had a certain coquetry of her own, using the usual methods with an
  individuality that was certainly fetching. For instance, when she lost
  her needle—and, another time, when we both, on hands and knees,
  hunted for her thimble.</p>
<p>However, directions for these pastimes may be found in contemporary
  classics.</p>
<p>I was as entertaining as I could be—perhaps not quite as entertaining
  as a young man usually thinks he is. However, we got on very well
  together until I asked <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>her tenderly who the harbor-master might be,
  whom they all discussed so mysteriously.</p>
<p>"I do not care to speak about it," she said, with a primness of which
  I had not suspected her capable.</p>
<p>Of course I could scarcely pursue the subject after that—and, indeed,
  I did not intend to—so I began to tell her how I fancied I had seen a
  man on the cliff that afternoon, and how the creature slid over the
  sheer rock like a snake.</p>
<p>To my amazement, she asked me to kindly discontinue the account of my
  adventures, in an icy tone, which left no room for protest.</p>
<p>"It was only a sea-otter," I tried to explain, thinking perhaps she
  did not care for snake stories.</p>
<p>But the explanation did not appear to interest her, and I was
  mortified to observe that my impression upon her was anything but
  pleasant.</p>
<p>"She doesn't seem to like me and my stories," thought I, "but she is
  too young, perhaps, to appreciate them."</p>
<p>So I forgave her—for she was even prettier than I had thought her at
  first—and I took my leave, saying that Mr. Halyard would doubtless
  direct me to my room.</p>
<p>Halyard was in his library, cleaning a revolver, when I entered.</p>
<p>"Your room is next to mine," he said; "pleasant dreams, and kindly
  refrain from snoring."</p>
<p>"May I venture an absurd hope that you will do the same!" I replied,
  politely.</p>
<p>That maddened him, so I hastily withdrew.</p>
<p>I had been asleep for at least two hours when a movement by my bedside
  and a light in my eyes awakened me. I sat bolt upright in bed,
  blinking at Halyard, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>who, clad in a dressing-gown and wearing a
  night-cap, had wheeled himself into my room with one hand, while with
  the other he solemnly waved a candle over my head.</p>
<p>"I'm so cursed lonely," he said—"come, there's a good fellow—talk to
  me in your own original, impudent way."</p>
<p>I objected strenuously, but he looked so worn and thin, so lonely and
  bad-tempered, so lovelessly grotesque, that I got out of bed and
  passed a spongeful of cold water over my head.</p>
<p>Then I returned to bed and propped the pillows up for a back-rest,
  ready to quarrel with him if it might bring some little pleasure into
  his morbid existence.</p>
<p>"No," he said, amiably, "I'm too worried to quarrel, but I'm much
  obliged for your kindly offer. I want to tell you something."</p>
<p>"What?" I asked, suspiciously.</p>
<p>"I want to ask you if you ever saw a man with gills like a fish?"</p>
<p>"Gills?" I repeated.</p>
<p>"Yes, gills! Did you?"</p>
<p>"No," I replied, angrily, "and neither did you."</p>
<p>"No, I never did," he said, in a curiously placid voice, "but there's
  a man with gills like a fish who lives in the ocean out there. Oh, you
  needn't look that way—nobody ever thinks of doubting my word, and I
  tell you that there's a man—or a thing that looks like a man—as big
  as you are, too—all slate-colored—with nasty red gills like a
  fish!—and I've a witness to prove what I say!"</p>
<p>"Who?" I asked, sarcastically.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>"The witness? My nurse."</p>
<p>"Oh! She saw a slate-colored man with gills?"</p>
<p>"Yes, she did. So did Francis Lee, superintendent of the Mica Quarry
  Company at Port-of-Waves. So have a dozen men who work in the quarry.
  Oh, you needn't laugh, young man. It's an old story here, and anybody
  can tell you about the harbor-master."</p>
<p>"The harbor-master!" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Yes, that slate-colored thing with gills, that looks like a
  man—and—by Heaven! <i>is</i> a man—that's the harbor-master. Ask any
  quarryman at Port-of-Waves what it is that comes purring around their
  boats at the wharf and unties painters and changes the mooring of
  every cat-boat in the cove at night! Ask Francis Lee what it was he
  saw running and leaping up and down the shoal at sunset last Friday!
  Ask anybody along the coast what sort of a thing moves about the
  cliffs like a man and slides over them into the sea like an otter—"</p>
<p>"I saw it do that!" I burst out.</p>
<p>"Oh, did you? Well, <i>what was it?</i>"</p>
<p>Something kept me silent, although a dozen explanations flew to my
  lips.</p>
<p>After a pause, Halyard said: "You saw the harbor-master, that's what
  you saw!"</p>
<p>I looked at him without a word.</p>
<p>"Don't mistake me," he said, pettishly; "I don't think that the
  harbor-master is a spirit or a sprite or a hobgoblin, or any sort of
  damned rot. Neither do I believe it to be an optical illusion."</p>
<p>"What do you think it is?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I think it's a man—I think it's a branch of the human race—that's
  what I think. Let me tell you <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>something: the deepest spot in the
  Atlantic Ocean is a trifle over five miles deep—and I suppose you
  know that this place lies only about a quarter of a mile off this
  headland. The British exploring vessel, <i>Gull</i>, Captain Marotte,
  discovered and sounded it, I believe. Anyway, it's there, and it's my
  belief that the profound depths are inhabited by the remnants of the
  last race of amphibious human beings!"</p>
<p>This was childish; I did not bother to reply.</p>
<p>"Believe it or not, as you will," he said, angrily; "one thing I know,
  and that is this: the harbor-master has taken to hanging around my
  cove, and he is attracted by my nurse! I won't have it! I'll blow his
  fishy gills out of his head if I ever get a shot at him! I don't care
  whether it's homicide or not—anyway, it's a new kind of murder and it
  attracts me!"</p>
<p>I gazed at him incredulously, but he was working himself into a
  passion, and I did not choose to say what I thought.</p>
<p>"Yes, this slate-colored thing with gills goes purring and grinning
  and spitting about after my nurse—when she walks, when she rows, when
  she sits on the beach! Gad! It drives me nearly frantic. I won't
  tolerate it, I tell you!"</p>
<p>"No," said I, "I wouldn't either." And I rolled over in bed convulsed
  with laughter.</p>
<p>The next moment I heard my door slam. I smothered my mirth and rose to
  close the window, for the land-wind blew cold from the forest, and a
  drizzle was sweeping the carpet as far as my bed.</p>
<p>That luminous glare which sometimes lingers after the stars go out,
  threw a trembling, nebulous radiance over <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>sand and cove. I heard the
  seething currents under the breakers' softened thunder—louder than I
  ever heard it. Then, as I closed my window, lingering for a last look
  at the crawling tide, I saw a man standing, ankle-deep, in the surf,
  all alone there in the night. But—was it a man? For the figure
  suddenly began running over the beach on all fours like a beetle,
  waving its limbs like feelers. Before I could throw open the window
  again it darted into the surf, and, when I leaned out into the
  chilling drizzle, I saw nothing save the flat ebb crawling on the
  coast—I heard nothing save the purring of bubbles on seething sands.</p>

</p><h3>V<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc" class="pginternal">ToC</a></span></h3>
<p><br>
</p><p>It took me a week to perfect my arrangements for transporting the
  great auks, by water, to Port-of-Waves, where a lumber schooner was to
  be sent from Petite Sainte Isole, chartered by me for a voyage to New
  York.</p>
<p>I had constructed a cage made of osiers, in which my auks were to
  squat until they arrived at Bronx Park. My telegrams to Professor
  Farrago were brief. One merely said "Victory!" Another explained that
  I wanted no assistance; and a third read: "Schooner chartered. Arrive
  New York July 1st. Send furniture-van to foot of Bluff Street."</p>
<p>My week as a guest of Mr. Halyard proved interesting. I wrangled with
  that invalid to his heart's content, I worked all day on my osier
  cage, I hunted the thimble in the moonlight with the pretty nurse. We
  sometimes found it.</p>
<p>As for the thing they called the harbor-master, I saw it a dozen
  times, but always either at night or so far away and so close to the
  sea that of course no trace of it remained when I reached the spot,
  rifle in hand.</p>
<p>I had quite made up my mind that the so-called harbor-master was a
  demented darky—wandered from, Heaven knows where—perhaps shipwrecked
  and gone mad from his sufferings. Still, it was far from pleasant <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>to
  know that the creature was strongly attracted by the pretty nurse.</p>
<p>She, however, persisted in regarding the harbor-master as a
  sea-creature; she earnestly affirmed that it had gills, like a fish's
  gills, that it had a soft, fleshy hole for a mouth, and its eyes were
  luminous and lidless and fixed.</p>
<p>"Besides," she said, with a shudder, "it's all slate color, like a
  porpoise, and it looks as wet as a sheet of india-rubber in a
  dissecting-room."</p>
<p>The day before I was to set sail with my auks in a cat-boat bound for
  Port-of-Waves, Halyard trundled up to me in his chair and announced
  his intention of going with me.</p>
<p>"Going where?" I asked.</p>
<p>"To Port-of-Waves and then to New York," he replied, tranquilly.</p>
<p>I was doubtful, and my lack of cordiality hurt his feelings.</p>
<p>"Oh, of course, if you need the sea-voyage—" I began.</p>
<p>"I don't; I need you," he said, savagely; "I need the stimulus of our
  daily quarrel. I never disagreed so pleasantly with anybody in my
  life; it agrees with me; I am a hundred per cent. better than I was
  last week."</p>
<p>I was inclined to resent this, but something in the deep-lined face of
  the invalid softened me. Besides, I had taken a hearty liking to the
  old pig.</p>
<p>"I don't want any mawkish sentiment about it," he said, observing me
  closely; "I won't permit anybody to feel sorry for me—do you
  understand?"</p>
<p>"I'll trouble you to use a different tone in addressing me," I
  replied, hotly; "I'll feel sorry for you if I choose <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>to!" And our
  usual quarrel proceeded, to his deep satisfaction.</p>
<p>By six o'clock next evening I had Halyard's luggage stowed away in the
  cat-boat, and the pretty nurse's effects corded down, with the newly
  hatched auk-chicks in a hat-box on top. She and I placed the osier
  cage aboard, securing it firmly, and then, throwing tablecloths over
  the auks' heads, we led those simple and dignified birds down the path
  and across the plank at the little wooden pier. Together we locked up
  the house, while Halyard stormed at us both and wheeled himself
  furiously up and down the beach below. At the last moment she forgot
  her thimble. But we found it, I forget where.</p>
<p>"Come on!" shouted Halyard, waving his shawls furiously; "what the
  devil are you about up there?"</p>
<p>He received our explanation with a sniff, and we trundled him aboard
  without further ceremony.</p>
<p>"Don't run me across the plank like a steamer trunk!" he shouted, as I
  shot him dexterously into the cock-pit. But the wind was dying away,
  and I had no time to dispute with him then.</p>
<p>The sun was setting above the pine-clad ridge as our sail flapped and
  partly filled, and I cast off, and began a long tack, east by south,
  to avoid the spouting rocks on our starboard bow.</p>
<p>The sea-birds rose in clouds as we swung across the shoal, the black
  surf-ducks scuttered out to sea, the gulls tossed their sun-tipped
  wings in the ocean, riding the rollers like bits of froth.</p>
<p>Already we were sailing slowly out across that great hole in the
  ocean, five miles deep, the most profound <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>sounding ever taken in the
  Atlantic. The presence of great heights or great depths, seen or
  unseen, always impresses the human mind—perhaps oppresses it. We were
  very silent; the sunlight stain on cliff and beach deepened to
  crimson, then faded into sombre purple bloom that lingered long after
  the rose-tint died out in the zenith.</p>
<p>Our progress was slow; at times, although the sail filled with the
  rising land breeze, we scarcely seemed to move at all.</p>
<p>"Of course," said the pretty nurse, "we couldn't be aground in the
  deepest hole in the Atlantic."</p>
<p>"Scarcely," said Halyard, sarcastically, "unless we're grounded on a
  whale."</p>
<p>"What's that soft thumping?" I asked. "Have we run afoul of a barrel
  or log?"</p>
<p>It was almost too dark to see, but I leaned over the rail and swept
  the water with my hand.</p>
<p>Instantly something smooth glided under it, like the back of a great
  fish, and I jerked my hand back to the tiller. At the same moment the
  whole surface of the water seemed to begin to purr, with a sound like
  the breaking of froth in a champagne-glass.</p>
<p>"What's the matter with you?" asked Halyard, sharply.</p>
<p>"A fish came up under my hand," I said; "a porpoise or something—"</p>
<p>With a low cry, the pretty nurse clasped my arm in both her hands.</p>
<p>"Listen!" she whispered. "It's purring around the boat."</p>
<p>"What the devil's purring?" shouted Halyard. "I won't have anything
  purring around me!"</p>
<p>At that moment, to my amazement, I saw that the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>boat had stopped
  entirely, although the sail was full and the small pennant fluttered
  from the mast-head. Something, too, was tugging at the rudder,
  twisting and jerking it until the tiller strained and creaked in my
  hand. All at once it snapped; the tiller swung useless and the boat
  whirled around, heeling in the stiffening wind, and drove shoreward.</p>
<p>It was then that I, ducking to escape the boom, caught a glimpse of
  something ahead—something that a sudden wave seemed to toss on deck
  and leave there, wet and flapping—a man with round, fixed, fishy
  eyes, and soft, slaty skin.</p>
<p>But the horror of the thing were the two gills that swelled and
  relaxed spasmodically, emitting a rasping, purring sound—two gasping,
  blood-red gills, all fluted and scolloped and distended.</p>
<p>Frozen with amazement and repugnance, I stared at the creature; I felt
  the hair stirring on my head and the icy sweat on my forehead.</p>
<p>"It's the harbor-master!" screamed Halyard.</p>
<p>The harbor-master had gathered himself into a wet lump, squatting
  motionless in the bows under the mast; his lidless eyes were
  phosphorescent, like the eyes of living codfish. After a while I felt
  that either fright or disgust was going to strangle me where I sat,
  but it was only the arms of the pretty nurse clasped around me in a
  frenzy of terror.</p>
<p>There was not a fire-arm aboard that we could get at. Halyard's hand
  crept backward where a steel-shod boat-hook lay, and I also made a
  clutch at it. The next moment I had it in my hand, and staggered
  forward, but the boat was already tumbling shoreward among the
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>breakers, and the next I knew the harbor-master ran at me like a
  colossal rat, just as the boat rolled over and over through the surf,
  spilling freight and passengers among the sea-weed-covered rocks.</p>
<p>When I came to myself I was thrashing about knee-deep in a rocky pool,
  blinded by the water and half suffocated, while under my feet, like a
  stranded porpoise, the harbor-master made the water boil in his
  efforts to upset me. But his limbs seemed soft and boneless; he had no
  nails, no teeth, and he bounced and thumped and flapped and splashed
  like a fish, while I rained blows on him with the boat-hook that
  sounded like blows on a football. And all the while his gills were
  blowing out and frothing, and purring, and his lidless eyes looked
  into mine, until, nauseated and trembling, I dragged myself back to
  the beach, where already the pretty nurse alternately wrung her hands
  and her petticoats in ornamental despair.</p>
<p>Beyond the cove, Halyard was bobbing up and down, afloat in his
  invalid's chair, trying to steer shoreward. He was the maddest man I
  ever saw.</p>
<p>"Have you killed that rubber-headed thing yet?" he roared.</p>
<p>"I can't kill it," I shouted, breathlessly. "I might as well try to
  kill a football!"</p>
<p>"Can't you punch a hole in it?" he bawled. "If I can only get at
  him—"</p>
<p>His words were drowned in a thunderous splashing, a roar of great,
  broad flippers beating the sea, and I saw the gigantic forms of my two
  great auks, followed by their chicks, blundering past in a shower of
  spray, driving headlong out into the ocean.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>"Oh, Lord!" I said. "I can't stand that," and, for the first time in
  my life, I fainted peacefully—and appropriately—at the feet of the
  pretty nurse.</p>
<hr style="width: 15%; padding-top: 1.25em; padding-bottom: 1.25em;">
<p>It is within the range of possibility that this story may be doubted.
  It doesn't matter; nothing can add to the despair of a man who has
  lost two great auks.</p>
<p>As for Halyard, nothing affects him—except his involuntary sea-bath,
  and that did him so much good that he writes me from the South that
  he's going on a walking-tour through Switzerland—if I'll join him. I
  might have joined him if he had not married the pretty nurse. I wonder
  whether—But, of course, this is no place for speculation.</p>
<p>In regard to the harbor-master, you may believe it or not, as you
  choose. But if you hear of any great auks being found, kindly throw a
  table-cloth over their heads and notify the authorities at the new
  Zoological Gardens in Bronx Park, New York. The reward is ten thousand
  dollars.</p>

<p><br>
</p><p>Before I proceed any further, common decency requires me to reassure
  my readers concerning my intentions, which, Heaven knows, are far from
  flippant.</p>
<p>To separate fact from fancy has always been difficult for me, but now
  that I have had the honor to be chosen secretary of the Zoological
  Gardens in Bronx Park, I realize keenly that unless I give up writing
  fiction nobody will believe what I write about science. Therefore it
  is to a serious and unimaginative public that I shall hereafter
  address myself; and I do it in the modest confidence that I shall
  neither be distrusted nor doubted, although unfortunately I still
  write in that irrational style which suggests covert frivolity, and
  for which I am undergoing a course of treatment in English literature
  at Columbia College. Now, having promised to avoid originality and
  confine myself to facts, I shall tell what I have to tell concerning
  the dingue, the mammoth, and—something else.</p>
<p>For some weeks it had been rumored that Professor Farrago, president
  of the Bronx Park Zoological Society, would resign, to accept an
  enormous salary as manager of Barnum &amp; Bailey's circus. He was now
  with the circus in London, and had promised to cable his decision
  before the day was over.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>I hoped he would decide to remain with us. I was his secretary and
  particular favorite, and I viewed, without enthusiasm, the advent of a
  new president, who might shake us all out of our congenial and
  carefully excavated ruts. However, it was plain that the trustees of
  the society expected the resignation of Professor Farrago, for they
  had been in secret session all day, considering the names of possible
  candidates to fill Professor Farrago's large, old-fashioned shoes.
  These preparations worried me, for I could scarcely expect another
  chief as kind and considerate as Professor Leonidas Farrago.</p>
<p>That afternoon in June I left my office in the Administration Building
  in Bronx Park and strolled out under the trees for a breath of air.
  But the heat of the sun soon drove me to seek shelter under a little
  square arbor, a shady retreat covered with purple wistaria and
  honeysuckle. As I entered the arbor I noticed that there were three
  other people seated there—an elderly lady with masculine features and
  short hair, a younger lady sitting beside her, and, farther away, a
  rough-looking young man reading a book.</p>
<p>For a moment I had an indistinct impression of having met the elder
  lady somewhere, and under circumstances not entirely agreeable, but
  beyond a stony and indifferent glance she paid no attention to me. As
  for the younger lady, she did not look at me at all. She was very
  young, with pretty eyes, a mass of silky brown hair, and a skin as
  fresh as a rose which had just been rained on.</p>
<p>With that delicacy peculiar to lonely scientific bachelors, I modestly
  sat down beside the rough young man, although there was more room
  beside the younger <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>lady. "Some lazy loafer reading a penny dreadful,"
  I thought, glancing at him, then at the title of his book. Hearing me
  beside him, he turned around and blinked over his shabby shoulder, and
  the movement uncovered the page he had been silently conning. The
  volume in his hands was Darwin's famous monograph on the monodactyl.</p>
<p>He noticed the astonishment on my face and smiled uneasily, shifting
  the short clay pipe in his mouth.</p>
<p>"I guess," he observed, "that this here book is too much for me,
  mister."</p>
<p>"It's rather technical," I replied, smiling.</p>
<p>"Yes," he said, in vague admiration; "it's fierce, ain't it?"</p>
<p>After a silence I asked him if he would tell me why he had chosen
  Darwin as a literary pastime.</p>
<p>"Well," he said, placidly, "I was tryin' to read about annermals, but
  I'm up against a word-slinger this time all right. Now here's a
  gum-twister," and he painfully spelled out m-o-n-o-d-a-c-t-y-l,
  breathing hard all the while.</p>
<p>"Monodactyl," I said, "means a single-toed creature."</p>
<p>He turned the page with alacrity. "Is that the beast he's talkin'
  about?" he asked.</p>
<p>The illustration he pointed out was a wood-cut representing Darwin's
  reconstruction of the dingue from the fossil bones in the British
  Museum. It was a well-executed wood-cut, showing a dingue in the
  foreground and, to give scale, a mammoth in the middle distance.</p>
<p>"Yes," I replied, "that is the dingue."</p>
<p>"I've seen one," he observed, calmly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>I smiled and explained that the dingue had been extinct for some
  thousands of years.</p>
<p>"Oh, I guess not," he replied, with cool optimism. Then he placed a
  grimy forefinger on the mammoth.</p>
<p>"I've seen them things, too," he remarked.</p>
<p>Again I patiently pointed out his error, and suggested that he
  referred to the elephant.</p>
<p>"Elephant be blowed!" he replied, scornfully. "I guess I know what I
  seen. An' I seen that there thing you call a dingue, too."</p>
<p>Not wishing to prolong a futile discussion, I remained silent. After a
  moment he wheeled around, removing his pipe from his hard mouth.</p>
<p>"Did you ever hear tell of Graham's Glacier?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"Certainly," I replied, astonished; "it's the southernmost glacier in
  British America."</p>
<p>"Right," he said. "And did you ever hear tell of the Hudson Mountings,
  mister?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>
<p>"What's behind 'em?" he snapped out.</p>
<p>"Nobody knows," I answered. "They are considered impassable."</p>
<p>"They ain't, though," he said, doggedly; "I've been behind 'em."</p>
<p>"Really!" I replied, tiring of his yarn.</p>
<p>"Ya-as, reely," he repeated, sullenly. Then he began to fumble and
  search through the pages of his book until he found what he wanted.
  "Mister," he said, "jest read that out loud, please."</p>
<p>The passage he indicated was the famous chapter beginning:</p>
<div class="block2"><p>"Is the mammoth extinct? Is the dingue extinct? Probably. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
  yet the aborigines of British America maintain the contrary.
  Probably both the mammoth and the dingue are extinct; but
  until expeditions have penetrated and explored not only the
  unknown region in Alaska but also that hidden table-land
  beyond the Graham Glacier and the Hudson Mountains, it will
  not be possible to definitely announce the total extinction of
  either the mammoth or the dingue."</p></div>
<p>When I had read it, slowly, for his benefit, he brought his hand down
  smartly on one knee and nodded rapidly.</p>
<p>"Mister," he said, "that gent knows a thing or two, and don't you
  forgit it!" Then he demanded, abruptly, how I knew he hadn't been
  behind the Graham Glacier.</p>
<p>I explained.</p>
<p>"Shucks!" he said; "there's a road five miles wide inter that there
  table-land. Mister, I ain't been in New York long; I come inter port a
  week ago on the <i>Arctic Belle</i>, whaler. I was in the Hudson range when
  that there Graham Glacier bust up—"</p>
<p>"What!" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Didn't you know it?" he asked. "Well, mebbe it ain't in the papers,
  but it busted all right—blowed up by a earthquake an' volcano
  combine. An', mister, it was oreful. My, how I did run!"</p>
<p>"Do you mean to tell me that some convulsion of the earth has
  shattered the Graham Glacier?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Convulsions? Ya-as, an' fits, too," he said, sulkily. "The hull blame
  thing dropped inter a hole. An' say, mister, home an' mother is good
  enough fur me now."</p>
<p>I stared at him stupidly.</p>
<p>"Once," he said, "I ketched pelts fur them sharps at Hudson Bay, like
  any yaller husky, but the things I seen arter that convulsion-fit—the
  <i>things I seen behind the</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span><i>Hudson Mountings</i>—don't make me hanker
  arter no life on the pe-rarie wild, lemme tell yer. I may be a Mother
  Carey chicken, but this chicken has got enough."</p>
<p>After a long silence I picked up his book again and pointed at the
  picture of the mammoth.</p>
<p>"What color is it?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Kinder red an' brown," he answered, promptly. "It's woolly, too."</p>
<p>Astounded, I pointed to the dingue.</p>
<p>"One-toed," he said, quickly; "makes a noise like a bell when
  scutterin' about."</p>
<p>Intensely excited, I laid my hand on his arm. "My society will give
  you a thousand dollars," I said, "if you pilot me inside the Hudson
  table-land and show me either a mammoth or a dingue!"</p>
<p>He looked me calmly in the eye.</p>
<p>"Mister," he said, slowly, "have you got a million for to squander on
  me?"</p>
<p>"No," I said, suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Because," he went on, "it wouldn't be enough. Home an' mother suits
  me now."</p>
<p>He picked up his book and rose. In vain I asked his name and address;
  in vain I begged him to dine with me—to become my honored guest.</p>
<p>"Nit," he said, shortly, and shambled off down the path.</p>
<p>But I was not going to lose him like that. I rose and deliberately
  started to stalk him. It was easy. He shuffled along, pulling on his
  pipe, and I after him.</p>
<p>It was growing a little dark, although the sun still reddened the tops
  of the maples. Afraid of losing him in the falling dusk, I once more
  approached him and laid my hand upon his ragged sleeve.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>"Look here," he cried, wheeling about, "I want you to quit follerin'
  me. Don't I tell you money can't make me go back to them mountings!"
  And as I attempted to speak, he suddenly tore off his cap and pointed
  to his head. His hair was white as snow.</p>
<p>"That's what come of monkeyin' inter your cursed mountings," he
  shouted, fiercely. "There's things in there what no Christian oughter
  see. Lemme alone er I'll bust yer."</p>
<p>He shambled on, doubled fists swinging by his side. The next moment,
  setting my teeth obstinately, I followed him and caught him by the
  park gate. At my hail he whirled around with a snarl, but I grabbed
  him by the throat and backed him violently against the park wall.</p>
<p>"You invaluable ruffian," I said, "now you listen to me. I live in
  that big stone building, and I'll give you a thousand dollars to take
  me behind the Graham Glacier. Think it over and call on me when you
  are in a pleasanter frame of mind. If you don't come by noon to-morrow
  I'll go to the Graham Glacier without you."</p>
<p>He was attempting to kick me all the time, but I managed to avoid him,
  and when I had finished I gave him a shove which almost loosened his
  spinal column. He went reeling out across the sidewalk, and when he
  had recovered his breath and his balance he danced with displeasure
  and displayed a vocabulary that astonished me. However, he kept his
  distance.</p>
<p>As I turned back into the park, satisfied that he would not follow,
  the first person I saw was the elderly, stony-faced lady of the
  wistaria arbor advancing on tiptoe. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>Behind her came the younger lady
  with cheeks like a rose that had been rained on.</p>
<p>Instantly it occurred to me that they had followed us, and at the same
  moment I knew who the stony-faced lady was. Angry, but polite, I
  lifted my hat and saluted her, and she, probably furious at having
  been caught tip-toeing after me, cut me dead. The younger lady passed
  me with face averted, but even in the dusk I could see the tip of one
  little ear turn scarlet.</p>
<p>Walking on hurriedly, I entered the Administration Building, and found
  Professor Lesard, of the reptilian department, preparing to leave.</p>
<p>"Don't you do it," I said, sharply; "I've got exciting news."</p>
<p>"I'm only going to the theatre," he replied. "It's a good show—Adam
  and Eve; there's a snake in it, you know. It's in my line."</p>
<p>"I can't help it," I said; and I told him briefly what had occurred in
  the arbor.</p>
<p>"But that's not all," I continued, savagely. "Those women followed us,
  and who do you think one of them turned out to be? Well, it was
  Professor Smawl, of Barnard College, and I'll bet every pair of boots
  I own that she starts for the Graham Glacier within a week. Idiot that
  I was!" I exclaimed, smiting my head with both hands. "I never
  recognized her until I saw her tip-toeing and craning her neck to
  listen. Now she knows about the glacier; she heard every word that
  young ruffian said, and she'll go to the glacier if it's only to
  forestall me."</p>
<p>Professor Lesard looked anxious. He knew that Miss Smawl, professor of
  natural history at Barnard College, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>had long desired an appointment
  at the Bronx Park gardens. It was even said she had a chance of
  succeeding Professor Farrago as president, but that, of course, must
  have been a joke. However, she haunted the gardens, annoying the
  keepers by persistently poking the animals with her umbrella. On one
  occasion she sent us word that she desired to enter the tigers'
  enclosure for the purpose of making experiments in hypnotism.
  Professor Farrago was absent, but I took it upon myself to send back
  word that I feared the tigers might injure her. The miserable small
  boy who took my message informed her that I was afraid she might
  injure the tigers, and the unpleasant incident almost cost me my
  position.</p>
<p>"I am quite convinced," said I to Professor Lesard, "that Miss Smawl
  is perfectly capable of abusing the information she overheard, and of
  starting herself to explore a region that, by all the laws of decency,
  justice, and prior claim, belongs to me."</p>
<p>"Well," said Lesard, with a peculiar laugh, "it's not certain whether
  you can go at all."</p>
<p>"Professor Farrago will authorize me," I said, confidently.</p>
<p>"Professor Farrago has resigned," said Lesard. It was a bolt from a
  clear sky.</p>
<p>"Good Heavens!" I blurted out. "What will become of the rest of us,
  then?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," he replied. "The trustees are holding a meeting over
  in the Administration Building to elect a new president for us. It
  depends on the new president what becomes of us."</p>
<p>"Lesard," I said, hoarsely, "you don't suppose that <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>they could
  possibly elect Miss Smawl as our president, do you?"</p>
<p>He looked at me askance and bit his cigar.</p>
<p>"I'd be in a nice position, wouldn't I?" said I, anxiously.</p>
<p>"The lady would probably make you walk the plank for that tiger
  business," he replied.</p>
<p>"But I didn't do it," I protested, with sickly eagerness. "Besides, I
  explained to her—"</p>
<p>He said nothing, and I stared at him, appalled by the possibility of
  reporting to Professor Smawl for instructions next morning.</p>
<p>"See here, Lesard," I said, nervously, "I wish you would step over to
  the Administration Building and ask the trustees if I may prepare for
  this expedition. Will you?"</p>
<p>He glanced at me sympathetically. It was quite natural for me to wish
  to secure my position before the new president was elected—especially
  as there was a chance of the new president being Miss Smawl.</p>
<p>"You are quite right," he said; "the Graham Glacier would be the
  safest place for you if our next president is to be the Lady of the
  Tigers." And he started across the park puffing his cigar.</p>
<p>I sat down on the doorstep to wait for his return, not at all charmed
  with the prospect. It made me furious, too, to see my ambition nipped
  with the frost of a possible veto from Miss Smawl.</p>
<p>"If she is elected," thought I, "there is nothing for me but to
  resign—to avoid the inconvenience of being shown the door. Oh, I wish
  I had allowed her to hypnotize the tigers!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>Thoughts of crime flitted through my mind. Miss Smawl would not remain
  president—or anything else very long—if she persisted in her desire
  for the tigers. And then when she called for help I would pretend not
  to hear.</p>
<p>Aroused from criminal meditation by the return of Professor Lesard, I
  jumped up and peered into his perplexed eyes. "They've elected a
  president," he said, "but they won't tell us who the president is
  until to-morrow."</p>
<p>"You don't think—" I stammered.</p>
<p>"I don't know. But I know this: the new president sanctions the
  expedition to the Graham Glacier, and directs you to choose an
  assistant and begin preparations for four people."</p>
<p>Overjoyed, I seized his hand and said, "Hurray!" in a voice weak with
  emotion. "The old dragon isn't elected this time," I added,
  triumphantly.</p>
<p>"By-the-way," he said, "who was the other dragon with her in the park
  this evening?"</p>
<p>I described her in a more modulated voice.</p>
<p>"Whew!" observed Professor Lesard, "that must be her assistant,
  Professor Dorothy Van Twiller! She's the prettiest blue-stocking in
  town."</p>
<p>With this curious remark my confrère followed me into my room and
  wrote down the list of articles I dictated to him. The list included a
  complete camping equipment for myself and three other men.</p>
<p>"Am I one of those other men?" inquired Lesard, with an unhappy smile.</p>
<p>Before I could reply my door was shoved open and a figure appeared at
  the threshold, cap in hand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>"What do you want?" I asked, sternly; but my heart was beating high
  with triumph.</p>
<p>The figure shuffled; then came a subdued voice:</p>
<p>"Mister, I guess I'll go back to the Graham Glacier along with you.
  I'm Billy Spike, an' it kinder scares me to go back to them Hudson
  Mountains, but somehow, mister, when you choked me and kinder walked
  me off on my ear, why, mister, I kinder took to you like."</p>
<p>There was absolute silence for a minute; then he said:</p>
<p>"So if you go, I guess I'll go, too, mister."</p>
<p>"For a thousand dollars?"</p>
<p>"Fur nawthin'," he muttered—"or what you like."</p>
<p>"All right, Billy," I said, briskly; "just look over those rifles and
  ammunition and see that everything's sound."</p>
<p>He slowly lifted his tough young face and gave me a doglike glance.
  They were hard eyes, but there was gratitude in them.</p>
<p>"You'll get your throat slit," whispered Lesard.</p>
<p>"Not while Billy's with me," I replied, cheerfully.</p>
<p>Late that night, as I was preparing for pleasant dreams, a knock came
  on my door and a telegraph-messenger handed me a note, which I read,
  shivering in my bare feet, although the thermometer marked eighty
  Fahrenheit:</p>
<div class="block2"><p>"You will immediately leave for the Hudson Mountains via
  Wellman Bay, Labrador, there to await further instructions.
  Equipment for yourself and one assistant will include
  following articles" [here began a list of camping utensils,
  scientific paraphernalia, and provisions]. "The steamer
  <i>Penguin</i> sails at five o'clock to-morrow morning. Kindly find
  yourself on board at that hour. Any excuse for not complying
  with these orders will be accepted as your resignation.</p>
  <p class="right">"<span class="sc" style="margin-right: 2em;">Susan Smawl,</span><br>
    "President Bronx Zoological Society."</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>"Lesard!" I shouted, trembling with fury.</p>
<p>He appeared at his door, chastely draped in pajamas; and he read the
  insolent letter with terrified alacrity.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do—resign?" he asked, much frightened.</p>
<p>"Do!" I snarled, grinding my teeth; "I'm going—that's what I'm going
  to do!"</p>
<p>"But—but you can't get ready and catch that steamer, too," he
  stammered.</p>
<p>He did not know me.</p>
<p><br>
</p><p><br>
</p><p><br>

</p><h3>VII<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc" class="pginternal">ToC</a></span></h3>
<p><br>
</p><p>And so it came about that one calm evening towards the end of June,
  William Spike and I went into camp under the southerly shelter of that
  vast granite wall called the Hudson Mountains, there to await the
  promised "further instructions."</p>
<p>It had been a tiresome trip by steamer to Anticosti, from there by
  schooner to Widgeon Bay, then down the coast and up the Cape Clear
  River to Port Porpoise. There we bought three pack-mules and started
  due north on the Great Fur Trail. The second day out we passed Fort
  Boisé, the last outpost of civilization, and on the sixth day we were
  travelling eastward under the granite mountain parapets.</p>
<p>On the evening of the sixth day out from Fort Boisé we went into camp
  for the last time before entering the unknown land.</p>
<p>I could see it already through my field-glasses, and while William was
  building the fire I climbed up among the rocks above and sat down,
  glasses levelled, to study the prospect.</p>
<p>There was nothing either extraordinary or forbidding in the landscape
  which stretched out beyond; to the right the solid palisade of granite
  cut off the view; to the left the palisade continued, an endless
  barrier of sheer cliffs crowned with pine and hemlock. But the
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>interesting section of the landscape lay almost directly in front of
  me—a rent in the mountain-wall through which appeared to run a level,
  arid plain, miles wide, and as smooth and even as a highroad.</p>
<p>There could be no doubt concerning the significance of that rent in
  the solid mountain-wall; and, moreover, it was exactly as William
  Spike had described it. However, I called to him and he came up from
  the smoky camp-fire, axe on shoulder.</p>
<p>"Yep," he said, squatting beside me; "the Graham Glacier used to
  meander through that there hole, but somethin' went wrong with the
  earth's in'ards an' there was a bust-up."</p>
<p>"And you saw it, William?" I said, with a sigh of envy.</p>
<p>"Hey? Seen it? Sure I seen it! I was to Spoutin' Springs, twenty mile
  west, with a bale o' blue fox an' otter pelt. Fust I knew them geysers
  begun for to groan egregious like, an' I seen the caribou gallopin'
  hell-bent south. 'This climate,' sez I, 'is too bracin' for me,' so I
  struck a back trail an' landed onto a hill. Then them geysers blowed
  up, one arter the next, an' I heard somethin' kinder cave in between
  here an' China. I disremember things what happened. Somethin' throwed
  me down, but I couldn't stay there, for the blamed ground was runnin'
  like a river—all wavy-like, an' the sky hit me on the back o' me
  head."</p>
<p>"And then?" I urged, in that new excitement which every repetition of
  the story revived. I had heard it all twenty times since we left New
  York, but mere repetition could not apparently satisfy me.</p>
<p>"Then," continued William, "the whole world kinder <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>went off like a
  fire-cracker, an' I come too, an' ran like—"</p>
<p>"I know," said I, cutting him short, for I had become wearied of the
  invariable profanity which lent a lurid ending to his narrative.</p>
<p>"After that," I continued, "you went through the rent in the
  mountains?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>"And you saw a dingue and a creature that resembled a mammoth?"</p>
<p>"Sure," he repeated, sulkily.</p>
<p>"And you saw something else?" I always asked this question; it
  fascinated me to see the sullen fright flicker in William's eyes, and
  the mechanical backward glance, as though what he had seen might still
  be behind him.</p>
<p>He had never answered this third question but once, and that time he
  fairly snarled in my face as he growled: "I seen what no Christian
  oughter see."</p>
<p>So when I repeated: "And you saw something else, William?" he gave me
  a wicked, frightened leer, and shuffled off to feed the mules.
  Flattery, entreaties, threats left him unmoved; he never told me what
  the third thing was that he had seen behind the Hudson Mountains.</p>
<p>William had retired to mix up with his mules; I resumed my binoculars
  and my silent inspection of the great, smooth path left by the Graham
  Glacier when something or other exploded that vast mass of ice into
  vapor.</p>
<p>The arid plain wound out from the unknown country like a river, and I
  thought then, and think now, that when <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>the glacier was blown into
  vapor the vapor descended in the most terrific rain the world has ever
  seen, and poured through the newly blasted mountain-gateway, sweeping
  the earth to bed-rock. To corroborate this theory, miles to the
  southward I could see the débris winding out across the land towards
  Wellman Bay, but as the terminal moraine of the vanished glacier
  formerly ended there I could not be certain that my theory was
  correct. Owing to the formation of the mountains I could not see more
  than half a mile into the unknown country. What I could see appeared
  to be nothing but the continuation of the glacier's path, scored out
  by the cloud-burst, and swept as smooth as a floor.</p>
<p>Sitting there, my heart beating heavily with excitement, I looked
  through the evening glow at the endless, pine-crowned mountain-wall
  with its giant's gateway pierced for me! And I thought of all the
  explorers and the unknown heroes—trappers, Indians, humble
  naturalists, perhaps—who had attempted to scale that sheer barricade
  and had died there or failed, beaten back from those eternal cliffs.
  Eternal? No! For the Eternal Himself had struck the rock, and it had
  sprung asunder, thundering obedience.</p>
<p>In the still evening air the smoke from the fire below mounted in a
  straight, slender pillar, like the smoke from those ancient altars
  builded before the first blood had been shed on earth.</p>
<p>The evening wind stirred the pines; a tiny spring brook made thin
  harmony among the rocks; a murmur came from the quiet camp. It was
  William adjuring his mules. In the deepening twilight I descended the
  hillock, stepping cautiously among the rocks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>Then, suddenly, as I stood outside the reddening ring of firelight,
  far in the depths of the unknown country, far behind the
  mountain-wall, a sound grew on the quiet air. William heard it and
  turned his face to the mountains. The sound faded to a vibration which
  was felt, not heard. Then once more I began to divine a vibration in
  the air, gathering in distant volume until it became a sound, lasting
  the space of a spoken word, fading to vibration, then silence.</p>
<p>Was it a cry?</p>
<p>I looked at William inquiringly. He had quietly fainted away.</p>
<p>I got him to the little brook and poked his head into the icy water,
  and after a while he sat up pluckily.</p>
<p>To an indignant question he replied: "Naw, I ain't a-cussin' you.
  Lemme be or I'll have fits."</p>
<p>"Was it that sound that scared you?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Ya-as," he replied with a dauntless shiver.</p>
<p>"Was it the voice of the mammoth?" I persisted, excitedly. "Speak,
  William, or I'll drag you about and kick you!"</p>
<p>He replied that it was neither a mammoth nor a dingue, and added a
  strong request for privacy, which I was obliged to grant, as I could
  not torture another word out of him.</p>
<p>I slept little that night; the exciting proximity of the unknown land
  was too much for me. But although I lay awake for hours, I heard
  nothing except the tinkle of water among the rocks and the plover
  calling from some hidden marsh. At daybreak I shot a ptarmigan which
  had walked into camp, and the shot set the echoes yelling among the
  mountains.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>William, sullen and heavy-eyed, dressed the bird, and we broiled it
  for breakfast.</p>
<p>Neither he nor I alluded to the sound we had heard the night before;
  he boiled water and cleaned up the mess-kit, and I pottered about
  among the rocks for another ptarmigan. Wearying of this, presently, I
  returned to the mules and William, and sat down for a smoke.</p>
<p>"It strikes me," I said, "that our instructions to 'await further
  orders' are idiotic. How are we to receive 'further orders' here?"</p>
<p>William did not know.</p>
<p>"You don't suppose," said I, in sudden disgust, "that Miss Smawl
  believes there is a summer hotel and daily mail service in the Hudson
  Mountains?"</p>
<p>William thought perhaps she did suppose something of the sort.</p>
<p>It irritated me beyond measure to find myself at last on the very
  border of the unknown country, and yet checked, held back, by the
  irresponsible orders of a maiden lady named Smawl. However, my salary
  depended upon the whim of that maiden lady, and although I fussed and
  fumed and glared at the mountains through my glasses, I realized that
  I could not stir without the permission of Miss Smawl. At times this
  grotesque situation became almost unbearable, and I often went away by
  myself and indulged in fantasies, firing my gun off and pretending I
  had hit Miss Smawl by mistake. At such moments I would imagine I was
  free at last to plunge into the strange country, and I would squat on
  a rock and dream of bagging my first mammoth.</p>
<p>The time passed heavily; the tension increased with <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>each new day. I
  shot ptarmigan and kept our table supplied with brook-trout. William
  chopped wood, conversed with his mules, and cooked very badly.</p>
<p>"See here," I said, one morning; "we have been in camp a week to-day,
  and I can't stand your cooking another minute!"</p>
<p>William, who was washing a saucepan, looked up and begged me
  sarcastically to accept the <i>cordon bleu</i>. But I know only how to cook
  eggs, and there were no eggs within some hundred miles.</p>
<p>To get the flavor of the breakfast out of my mouth I walked up to my
  favorite hillock and sat down for a smoke. The next moment, however, I
  was on my feet, cheering excitedly and shouting for William.</p>
<p>"Here come 'further instructions' at last!" I cried, pointing to the
  southward, where two dots on the grassy plain were imperceptibly
  moving in our direction.</p>
<p>"People on mules," said William, without enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"They must be messengers for us!" I cried, in chaste joy. "Three
  cheers for the northward trail, William, and the mischief take
  Miss—Well, never mind now," I added.</p>
<p>"On them approachin' mules," observed William, "there is wimmen."</p>
<p>I stared at him for a second, then attempted to strike him. He dodged
  wearily and repeated his incredible remark: "Ya-as, there
  is—wimmen—two female ladies onto them there mules."</p>
<p>"Bring me my glasses!" I said, hoarsely; "bring me those glasses,
  William, because I shall destroy you if you don't!"</p>
<p>Somewhat awed by my calm fury, he hastened back <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>to camp and returned
  with the binoculars. It was a breathless moment. I adjusted the lenses
  with a steady hand and raised them.</p>
<p>Now, of all unexpected sights my fate may reserve for me in the
  future, I trust—nay, I know—that none can ever prove as unwelcome as
  the sight I perceived through my binoculars. For upon the backs of
  those distant mules were two women, and the first one was Miss Smawl!</p>
<p>Upon her head she wore a helmet, from which fluttered a green veil.
  Otherwise she was clothed in tweeds; and at moments she beat upon her
  mule with a thick umbrella.</p>
<p>Surfeited with the sickening spectacle, I sat down on a rock and tried
  to cry.</p>
<p>"I told yer so," observed William; but I was too tired to attack him.</p>
<p>When the caravan rode into camp I was myself again, smilingly prepared
  for the worst, and I advanced, cap in hand, followed furtively by
  William.</p>
<p>"Welcome," I said, violently injecting joy into my voice. "Welcome,
  Professor Smawl, to the Hudson Mountains!"</p>
<p>"Kindly take my mule," she said, climbing down to mother earth.</p>
<p>"William," I said, with dignity, "take the lady's mule."</p>
<p>Miss Smawl gave me a stolid glance, then made directly for the
  camp-fire, where a kettle of game-broth simmered over the coals. The
  last I saw of her she was smelling of it, and I turned my back and
  advanced towards the second lady pilgrim, prepared to be civil until
  snubbed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>Now, it is quite certain that never before had William Spike or I
  beheld so much feminine loveliness in one human body on the back of a
  mule. She was clad in the daintiest of shooting-kilts, yet there was
  nothing mannish about her except the way she rode the mule, and that
  only accentuated her adorable femininity.</p>
<p>I remembered what Professor Lesard had said about blue stockings—but
  Miss Dorothy Van Twiller's were gray, turned over at the tops, and
  disappearing into canvas spats buckled across a pair of slim
  shooting-boots.</p>
<p>"Welcome," said I, attempting to restrain a too violent cordiality.
  "Welcome, Professor Van Twiller, to the Hudson Mountains."</p>
<p>"Thank you," she replied, accepting my assistance very sweetly; "it is
  a pleasure to meet a human being again."</p>
<p>I glanced at Miss Smawl. She was eating game-broth, but she resembled
  a human being in a general way.</p>
<p>"I should very much like to wash my hands," said Professor Van
  Twiller, drawing the buckskin gloves from her slim fingers.</p>
<p>I brought towels and soap and conducted her to the brook.</p>
<p>She called to Professor Smawl to join her, and her voice was
  crystalline; Professor Smawl declined, and her voice was batrachian.</p>
<p>"She is so hungry!" observed Miss Van Twiller. "I am very thankful we
  are here at last, for we've had a horrid time. You see, we neither of
  us know how to cook."</p>
<p>I wondered what they would say to William's cooking, but I held my
  peace and retired, leaving the little brook to mirror the sweetest
  face that was ever bathed in water.</p>

<p><br>
</p><p>That afternoon our expedition, in two sections, moved forward. The
  first section comprised myself and all the mules; the second section
  was commanded by Professor Smawl, followed by Professor Van Twiller,
  armed with a tiny shot-gun. William, loaded down with the ladies'
  toilet articles, skulked in the rear. I say skulked; there was no
  other word for it.</p>
<p>"So you're a guide, are you?" observed Professor Smawl when William,
  cap in hand, had approached her with well-meant advice. "The woods are
  full of lazy guides. Pick up those Gladstone bags! I'll do the guiding
  for this expedition."</p>
<p>Made cautious by William's humiliation, I associated with the mules
  exclusively. Nevertheless, Professor Smawl had her hard eyes on me,
  and I realized she meant mischief.</p>
<p>The encounter took place just as I, driving the five mules, entered
  the great mountain gateway, thrilled with anticipation which almost
  amounted to foreboding. As I was about to set foot across the
  imaginary frontier which divided the world from the unknown land,
  Professor Smawl hailed me and I halted until she came up.</p>
<p>"As commander of this expedition," she said, somewhat out of breath,
  "I desire to be the first living <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>creature who has ever set foot
  behind the Graham Glacier. Kindly step aside, young sir!"</p>
<p>"Madam," said I, rigid with disappointment, "my guide, William Spike,
  entered that unknown land a year ago."</p>
<p>"He <i>says</i> he did," sneered Professor Smawl.</p>
<p>"As you like," I replied; "but it is scarcely generous to forestall
  the person whose stupidity gave you the clew to this unexplored
  region."</p>
<p>"You mean yourself?" she asked, with a stony stare.</p>
<p>"I do," said I, firmly.</p>
<p>Her little, hard eyes grew harder, and she clutched her umbrella until
  the steel ribs crackled.</p>
<p>"Young man," she said, insolently; "if I could have gotten rid of you
  I should have done so the day I was appointed president. But Professor
  Farrago refused to resign unless your position was assured, subject,
  of course, to your good behavior. Frankly, I don't like you, and I
  consider your views on science ridiculous, and if an opportunity
  presents itself I will be most happy to request your resignation.
  Kindly collect your mules and follow me."</p>
<p>Mortified beyond measure, I collected my mules and followed my
  president into the strange country behind the Hudson Mountains—I who
  had aspired to lead, compelled to follow in the rear, driving mules.</p>
<p>The journey was monotonous at first, but we shortly ascended a ridge
  from which we could see, stretching out below us, the wilderness
  where, save the feet of William Spike, no human feet had passed.</p>
<p>As for me, tingling with enthusiasm, I forgot my chagrin, I forgot the
  gross injustice, I forgot my mules. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>"Excelsior!" I cried, running up
  and down the ridge in uncontrollable excitement at the sublime
  spectacle of forest, mountain, and valley all set with little lakes.</p>
<p>"Excelsior!" repeated an excited voice at my side, and Professor Van
  Twiller sprang to the ridge beside me, her eyes bright as stars.</p>
<p>Exalted, inspired by the mysterious beauty of the view, we clasped
  hands and ran up and down the grassy ridge.</p>
<p>"That will do," said Professor Smawl, coldly, as we raced about like a
  pair of distracted kittens. The chilling voice broke the spell; I
  dropped Professor Van Twiller's hand and sat down on a bowlder, aching
  with wrath.</p>
<p>Late that afternoon we halted beside a tiny lake, deep in the unknown
  wilderness, where purple and scarlet bergamot choked the shores and
  the spruce-partridge strutted fearlessly under our very feet. Here we
  pitched our two tents. The afternoon sun slanted through the pines;
  the lake glittered; acres of golden brake perfumed the forest silence,
  broken only at rare intervals by the distant thunder of a partridge
  drumming.</p>
<p>Professor Smawl ate heavily and retired to her tent to lie torpid
  until evening. William drove the unloaded mules into an intervale full
  of sun-cured, fragrant grasses; I sat down beside Professor Van
  Twiller.</p>
<p>The wilderness is electric. Once within the influence of its currents,
  human beings become positively or negatively charged, violently
  attracting or repelling each other.</p>
<p>"There is something the matter with this air," said Professor Van
  Twiller. "It makes me feel as though <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>I were desperately enamoured of
  the entire human race."</p>
<p>She leaned back against a pine, smiling vaguely, and crossing one knee
  over the other.</p>
<p>Now I am not bold by temperament, and, normally, I fear ladies.
  Therefore it surprised me to hear myself begin a frivolous <i>causerie</i>,
  replying to her pretty epigrams with epigrams of my own, advancing to
  the borderland of badinage, fearlessly conducting her and myself over
  that delicate frontier to meet upon the terrain of undisguised
  flirtation.</p>
<p>It was clear that she was out for a holiday. The seriousness and
  restraints of twenty-two years she had left behind her in the
  civilized world, and now, with a shrug of her young shoulders, she
  unloosened her burden of reticence, dignity, and responsibility and
  let the whole load fall with a discreet thud.</p>
<p>"Even hares go mad in March," she said, seriously. "I know you intend
  to flirt with me—and I don't care. Anyway, there's nothing else to
  do, is there?"</p>
<p>"Suppose," said I, solemnly, "I should take you behind that big tree
  and attempt to kiss you!"</p>
<p>The prospect did not appear to appall her, so I looked around with
  that sneaking yet conciliatory caution peculiar to young men who are
  novices in the art. Before I had satisfied myself that neither William
  nor the mules were observing us, Professor Van Twiller rose to her
  feet and took a short step backward.</p>
<p>"Let's set traps for a dingue," she said, "will you?"</p>
<p>I looked at the big tree, undecided. "Come on," she said; "I'll show
  you how." And away we went into the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>woods, she leading, her kilts
  flashing through the golden half-light.</p>
<p>Now I had not the faintest notion how to trap the dingue, but
  Professor Van Twiller asserted that it formerly fed on the tender tips
  of the spruce, quoting Darwin as her authority.</p>
<p>So we gathered a bushel of spruce-tips, piled them on the bank of a
  little stream, then built a miniature stockade around the bait, a foot
  high. I roofed this with hemlock, then laboriously whittled out and
  adjusted a swinging shutter for the entrance, setting it on springy
  twigs.</p>
<p>"The dingue, you know, was supposed to live in the water," she said,
  kneeling beside me over our trap.</p>
<p>I took her little hand and thanked her for the information.</p>
<p>"Doubtless," she said, enthusiastically, "a dingue will come out of
  the lake to-night to feed on our spruce-tips. Then," she added, "we've
  got him."</p>
<p>"True!" I said, earnestly, and pressed her fingers very gently.</p>
<p>Her face was turned a little away; I don't remember what she said; I
  don't remember that she said anything. A faint rose-tint stole over
  her cheek. A few moments later she said: "You must not do that again."</p>
<p>It was quite late when we strolled back to camp. Long before we came
  in sight of the twin tents we heard a deep voice bawling our names. It
  was Professor Smawl, and she pounced upon Dorothy and drove her
  ignominiously into the tent.</p>
<p>"As for you," she said, in hollow tones, "you may <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>explain your
  conduct at once, or place your resignation at my disposal."</p>
<p>But somehow or other I appeared to be temporarily lost to shame, and I
  only smiled at my infuriated president, and entered my own tent with a
  step that was distinctly frolicsome.</p>
<p>"Billy," said I to William Spike, who regarded me morosely from the
  depths of the tent, "I'm going out to bag a mammoth to-morrow, so
  kindly clean my elephant-gun and bring an axe to chop out the tusks."</p>
<p>That night Professor Smawl complained bitterly of the cooking, but as
  neither Dorothy nor I knew how to improve it, she revenged herself on
  us by eating everything on the table and retiring to bed, taking
  Dorothy with her.</p>
<p>I could not sleep very well; the mosquitoes were intrusive, and
  Professor Smawl dreamed she was a pack of wolves and yelped in her
  sleep.</p>
<p>"Bird, ain't she?" said William, roused from slumber by her weird
  noises.</p>
<p>Dorothy, much frightened, crawled out of her tent, where her
  blanket-mate still dreamed dyspeptically, and William and I made her
  comfortable by the camp-fire.</p>
<p>It takes a pretty girl to look pretty half asleep in a blanket.</p>
<p>"Are you sure you are quite well?" I asked her.</p>
<p>To make sure, I tested her pulse. For an hour it varied more or less,
  but without alarming either of us. Then she went back to bed and I sat
  alone by the camp-fire.</p>
<p>Towards midnight I suddenly began to feel that strange, distant
  vibration that I had once before felt. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>As before, the vibration grew
  on the still air, increasing in volume until it became a sound, then
  died out into silence.</p>
<p>I rose and stole into my tent.</p>
<p>William, white as death, lay in his corner, weeping in his sleep.</p>
<p>I roused him remorselessly, and he sat up scowling, but refused to
  tell me what he had been dreaming.</p>
<p>"Was it about that third thing you saw—" I began. But he snarled up
  at me like a startled animal, and I was obliged to go to bed and toss
  about and speculate.</p>
<p>The next morning it rained. Dorothy and I visited our dingue-trap but
  found nothing in it. We were inclined, however, to stay out in the
  rain behind a big tree, but Professor Smawl vetoed that proposition
  and sent me off to supply the larder with fresh meat.</p>
<p>I returned, mad and wet, with a dozen partridges and a white
  hare—brown at that season—and William cooked them vilely.</p>
<p>"I can taste the feathers!" said Professor Smawl, indignantly.</p>
<p>"There is no accounting for taste," I said, with a polite gesture of
  deprecation; "personally, I find feathers unpalatable."</p>
<p>"You may hand in your resignation this evening!" cried Professor
  Smawl, in hollow tones of passion.</p>
<p>I passed her the pancakes with a cheerful smile, and flippantly
  pressed the hand next me. Unexpectedly it proved to be William's
  sticky fist, and Dorothy and I laughed until her tears ran into
  Professor Smawl's coffee-cup—an accident which kindled her wrath to
  red heat, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>and she requested my resignation five times during the
  evening.</p>
<p>The next day it rained again, more or less. Professor Smawl complained
  of the cooking, demanded my resignation, and finally marched out to
  explore, lugging the reluctant William with her. Dorothy and I sat
  down behind the largest tree we could find.</p>
<p>I don't remember what we were saying when a peculiar sound interrupted
  us, and we listened earnestly.</p>
<p>It was like a bell in the woods, ding-dong! ding-dong! ding-dong!—a
  low, mellow, golden harmony, coming nearer, then stopping.</p>
<p>I clasped Dorothy in my arms in my excitement.</p>
<p>"It is the note of the dingue!" I whispered, "and that explains its
  name, handed down from remote ages along with the names of the
  behemoth and the coney. It was because of its bell-like cry that it
  was named! Darling!" I cried, forgetting our short acquaintance, "we
  have made a discovery that the whole world will ring with!"</p>
<p>Hand in hand we tiptoed through the forest to our trap. There was
  something in it that took fright at our approach and rushed
  panic-stricken round and round the interior of the trap, uttering its
  alarm-note, which sounded like the jangling of a whole string of
  bells.</p>
<p>I seized the strangely beautiful creature; it neither attempted to
  bite nor scratch, but crouched in my arms, trembling and eying me.</p>
<p>Delighted with the lovely, tame animal, we bore it tenderly back to
  the camp and placed it on my blanket. Hand in hand we stood before it,
  awed by the sight of this beast, so long believed to be extinct.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>"It is too good to be true," sighed Dorothy, clasping her white hands
  under her chin and gazing at the dingue in rapture.</p>
<p>"Yes," said I, solemnly, "you and I, my child, are face to face with
  the fabled dingue—<i>Dingus solitarius</i>! Let us continue to gaze at it,
  reverently, prayerfully, humbly—"</p>
<p>Dorothy yawned—probably with excitement.</p>
<p>We were still mutely adoring the dingue when Professor Smawl burst
  into the tent at a hand-gallop, bawling hoarsely for her kodak and
  note-book.</p>
<p>Dorothy seized her triumphantly by the arm and pointed at the dingue,
  which appeared to be frightened to death.</p>
<p>"What!" cried Professor Smawl, scornfully; "<i>that</i> a dingue? Rubbish!"</p>
<p>"Madam," I said, firmly, "it is a dingue! It's a monodactyl! See! It
  has but a single toe!"</p>
<p>"Bosh!" she retorted; "it's got four!"</p>
<p>"Four!" I repeated, blankly.</p>
<p>"Yes; one on each foot!"</p>
<p>"Of course," I said; "you didn't suppose a monodactyl meant a beast
  with one leg and one toe!"</p>
<p>But she laughed hatefully and declared it was a woodchuck.</p>
<p>We squabbled for a while until I saw the significance of her attitude.
  The unfortunate woman wished to find a dingue first and be accredited
  with the discovery.</p>
<p>I lifted the dingue in both hands and shook the creature gently, until
  the chiming ding-dong of its protestations filled our ears like sweet
  bells jangled out of tune.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>Pale with rage at this final proof of the dingue's identity, she
  seized her camera and note-book.</p>
<p>"I haven't any time to waste over that musical woodchuck!" she
  shouted, and bounced out of the tent.</p>
<p>"What have you discovered, dear?" cried Dorothy, running after her.</p>
<p>"A mammoth!" bawled Professor Smawl, triumphantly; "and I'm going to
  photograph him!"</p>
<p>Neither Dorothy nor I believed her. We watched the flight of the
  infatuated woman in silence.</p>
<p>And now, at last, the tragic shadow falls over my paper as I write. I
  was never passionately attached to Professor Smawl, yet I would gladly
  refrain from chronicling the episode that must follow if, as I have
  hitherto attempted, I succeed in sticking to the unornamented truth.</p>
<p>I have said that neither Dorothy nor I believed her. I don't know why,
  unless it was that we had not yet made up our minds to believe that
  the mammoth still existed on earth. So, when Professor Smawl
  disappeared in the forest, scuttling through the underbrush like a
  demoralized hen, we viewed her flight with unconcern. There was a
  large tree in the neighborhood—a pleasant shelter in case of rain. So
  we sat down behind it, although the sun was shining fiercely.</p>
<p>It was one of those peaceful afternoons in the wilderness when the
  whole forest dreams, and the shadows are asleep and every little
  leaflet takes a nap. Under the still tree-tops the dappled sunlight,
  motionless, soaked the sod; the forest-flies no longer whirled in
  circles, but sat sunning their wings on slender twig-tips.</p>
<p>The heat was sweet and spicy; the sun drew out the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>delicate essence
  of gum and sap, warming volatile juices until they exhaled through the
  aromatic bark.</p>
<p>The sun went down into the wilderness; the forest stirred in its
  sleep; a fish splashed in the lake. The spell was broken. Presently
  the wind began to rise somewhere far away in the unknown land. I heard
  it coming, nearer, nearer—a brisk wind that grew heavier and blew
  harder as it neared us—a gale that swept distant branches—a furious
  gale that set limbs clashing and cracking, nearer and nearer. Crack!
  and the gale grew to a hurricane, trampling trees like dead twigs!
  Crack! Crackle! Crash! Crash!</p>
<p><i>Was it the wind?</i></p>
<p>With the roaring in my ears I sprang up, staring into the forest
  vista, and at the same instant, out of the crashing forest, sped
  Professor Smawl, skirts tucked up, thin legs flying like
  bicycle-spokes. I shouted, but the crashing drowned my voice. Then all
  at once the solid earth began to shake, and with the rush and roar of
  a tornado a gigantic living thing burst out of the forest before our
  eyes—a vast shadowy bulk that rocked and rolled along, mowing down
  trees in its course.</p>
<p>Two great crescents of ivory curved from its head; its back swept
  through the tossing tree-tops. Once it bellowed like a gun fired from
  a high bastion.</p>
<p>The apparition passed with the noise of thunder rolling on towards the
  ends of the earth. Crack! crash! went the trees, the tempest swept
  away in a rolling volley of reports, distant, more distant, until,
  long after the tumult had deadened, then ceased, the stunned forest
  echoed with the fall of mangled branches slowly dropping.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>That evening an agitated young couple sat close together in the
  deserted camp, calling timidly at intervals for Professor Smawl and
  William Spike. I say timidly, because it is correct; we did not care
  to have a mammoth respond to our calls. The lurking echoes across the
  lake answered our cries; the full moon came up over the forest to look
  at us. We were not much to look at. Dorothy was moistening my shoulder
  with unfeigned tears, and I, afraid to light the fire, sat hunched up
  under the common blanket, wildly examining the darkness around us.</p>
<p>Chilled to the spinal marrow, I watched the gray lights whiten in the
  east. A single bird awoke in the wilderness. I saw the nearer trees
  looming in the mist, and the silver fog rolling on the lake.</p>
<p>All night long the darkness had vibrated with the strange monotone
  which I had heard the first night, camping at the gate of the unknown
  land. My brain seemed to echo that subtle harmony which rings in the
  auricular labyrinth after sound has ceased.</p>
<p>There are ghosts of sound which return to haunt long after sound is
  dead. It was these voiceless spectres of a voice long dead that
  stirred the transparent silence, intoning toneless tones.</p>
<p>I think I make myself clear.</p>
<p>It was an uncanny night; morning whitened the east; gray daylight
  stole into the woods, blotting the shadows to paler tints. It was
  nearly mid-day before the sun became visible through the fine-spun web
  of mist—a pale spot of gilt in the zenith.</p>
<p>By this pallid light I labored to strike the two empty tents, gather
  up our equipments and pack them on our <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>five mules. Dorothy aided me
  bravely, whimpering when I spoke of Professor Smawl and William Spike,
  but abating nothing of her industry until we had the mules loaded and
  I was ready to drive them, Heaven knows whither.</p>
<p>"Where shall we go?" quavered Dorothy, sitting on a log with the
  dingue in her lap.</p>
<p>One thing was certain; this mammoth-ridden land was no place for
  women, and I told her so.</p>
<p>We placed the dingue in a basket and tied it around the leading mule's
  neck. Immediately the dingue, alarmed, began dingling like a cow-bell.
  It acted like a charm on the other mules, and they gravely filed off
  after their leader, following the bell. Dorothy and I, hand in hand,
  brought up the rear.</p>
<p>I shall never forget that scene in the forest—the gray arch of the
  heavens swimming in mist through which the sun peered shiftily, the
  tall pines wavering through the fog, the preoccupied mules marching
  single file, the foggy bell-note of the gentle dingue in its swinging
  basket, and Dorothy, limp kilts dripping with dew, plodding through
  the white dusk.</p>
<p>We followed the terrible tornado-path which the mammoth had left in
  its wake, but there were no traces of its human victims—neither one
  jot of Professor Smawl nor one solitary tittle of William Spike.</p>
<p>And now I would be glad to end this chapter if I could; I would gladly
  leave myself as I was, there in the misty forest, with an arm
  encircling the slender body of my little companion, and the mules
  moving in a monotonous line, and the dingue discreetly jingling—but
  again that menacing shadow falls across my page, and truth bids <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>me
  tell all, and I, the slave of accuracy, must remember my vows as the
  dauntless disciple of truth.</p>
<p>Towards sunset—or that pale parody of sunset which set the forest
  swimming in a ghastly, colorless haze—the mammoth's trail of ruin
  brought us suddenly out of the trees to the shore of a great sheet of
  water.</p>
<p>It was a desolate spot; northward a chaos of sombre peaks rose, piled
  up like thunder-clouds along the horizon; east and south the darkening
  wilderness spread like a pall. Westward, crawling out into the mist
  from our very feet, the gray waste of water moved under the dull sky,
  and flat waves slapped the squatting rocks, heavy with slime.</p>
<p>And now I understood why the trail of the mammoth continued straight
  into the lake, for on either hand black, filthy tamarack swamps lay
  under ghostly sheets of mist. I strove to creep out into the bog,
  seeking a footing, but the swamp quaked and the smooth surface
  trembled like jelly in a bowl. A stick thrust into the slime sank into
  unknown depths.</p>
<p>Vaguely alarmed, I gained the firm land again and looked around,
  believing there was no road open but the desolate trail we had
  traversed. But I was in error; already the leading mule was wading out
  into the water, and the others, one by one, followed.</p>
<p>How wide the lake might be we could not tell, because the band of fog
  hung across the water like a curtain. Yet out into this flat, shallow
  void our mules went steadily, slop! slop! slop! in single file.
  Already they were growing indistinct in the fog, so I bade Dorothy
  hasten and take off her shoes and stockings.</p>
<p>She was ready before I was, I having to unlace my <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>shooting-boots, and
  she stepped out into the water, kilts fluttering, moving her white
  feet cautiously. In a moment I was beside her, and we waded forward,
  sounding the shallow water with our poles.</p>
<p>When the water had risen to Dorothy's knees I hesitated, alarmed. But
  when we attempted to retrace our steps we could not find the shore
  again, for the blank mist shrouded everything, and the water deepened
  at every step.</p>
<p>I halted and listened for the mules. Far away in the fog I heard a
  dull splashing, receding as I listened. After a while all sound died
  away, and a slow horror stole over me—a horror that froze the little
  net-work of veins in every limb. A step to the right and the water
  rose to my knees; a step to the left and the cold, thin circle of the
  flood chilled my breast. Suddenly Dorothy screamed, and the next
  moment a far cry answered—a far, sweet cry that seemed to come from
  the sky, like the rushing harmony of the world's swift winds. Then the
  curtain of fog before us lighted up from behind; shadows moved on the
  misty screen, outlines of trees and grassy shores, and tiny birds
  flying. Thrown on the vapory curtain, in silhouette, a man and a woman
  passed under the lovely trees, arms about each other's necks; near
  them the shadows of five mules grazed peacefully; a dingue gambolled
  close by.</p>
<p>"It is a mirage!" I muttered, but my voice made no sound. Slowly the
  light behind the fog died out; the vapor around us turned to rose,
  then dissolved, while mile on mile of a limitless sea spread away
  till, like a quick line pencilled at a stroke, the horizon cut sky and
  sea in half, and before us lay an ocean from which <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>towered a mountain
  of snow—or a gigantic berg of milky ice—for it was moving.</p>
<p>"Good Heavens," I shrieked; "it is alive!"</p>
<p>At the sound of my crazed cry the mountain of snow became a pillar,
  towering to the clouds, and a wave of golden glory drenched the figure
  to its knees! Figure? Yes—for a colossal arm shot across the sky,
  then curved back in exquisite grace to a head of awful beauty—a
  woman's head, with eyes like the blue lake of heaven—ay, a woman's
  splendid form, upright from the sky to the earth, knee-deep in the
  sea. The evening clouds drifted across her brow; her shimmering hair
  lighted the world beneath with sunset. Then, shading her white brow
  with one hand, she bent, and with the other hand dipped in the sea,
  she sent a wave rolling at us. Straight out of the horizon it sped—a
  ripple that grew to a wave, then to a furious breaker which caught us
  up in a whirl of foam, bearing us onward, faster, faster, swiftly
  flying through leagues of spray until consciousness ceased and all was
  blank.</p>
<p>Yet ere my senses fled I heard again that strange cry—that sweet,
  thrilling harmony rushing out over the foaming waters, filling earth
  and sky with its soundless vibrations.</p>
<p>And I knew it was the hail of the Spirit of the North warning us back
  to life again.</p>
<hr style="width: 15%; padding-top: 1.25em; padding-bottom: 1.25em;">
<p>Looking back, now, over the days that passed before we staggered into
  the Hudson Bay outpost at Gravel Cove, I am inclined to believe that
  neither Dorothy nor I were clothed entirely in our proper minds—or,
  if we were, our minds, no doubt, must have been in the same <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>condition
  as our clothing. I remember shooting ptarmigan, and that we ate them;
  flashes of memory recall the steady downpour of rain through the
  endless twilight of shaggy forests; dim days on the foggy tundra,
  mud-holes from which the wild ducks rose in thousands; then the
  stunted hemlocks, then the forest again. And I do not even recall the
  moment when, at last, stumbling into the smooth path left by the
  Graham Glacier, we crawled through the mountain-wall, out of the
  unknown land, and once more into a world protected by the Lord
  Almighty.</p>
<p>A hunting-party of Elbon Indians brought us in to the post, and
  everybody was most kind—that I remember, just before going into
  several weeks of unpleasant delirium mercifully mitigated with
  unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, Professor Van Twiller was not very much battered,
  physically, for I had carried her for days, pickaback. But the awful
  experience had produced a shock which resulted in a nervous condition
  that lasted so long after she returned to New York that the wealthy
  and eminent specialist who attended her insisted upon taking her to
  the Riviera and marrying her. I sometimes wonder—but, as I have said,
  such reflections have no place in these austere pages.</p>
<p>However, anybody, I fancy, is at liberty to speculate upon the fate of
  the late Professor Smawl and William Spike, and upon the mules and the
  gentle dingue. Personally, I am convinced that the suggestive
  silhouettes I saw on that ghastly curtain of fog were cast by
  beatified beings in some earthly paradise—a mirage of bliss of which
  we caught but the colorless shadow-shapes floating 'twixt sea and
  sky.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>At all events, neither Professor Smawl nor her William Spike ever
  returned; no exploring expedition has found a trace of mule or lady,
  of William or the dingue. The new expedition to be organized by
  Barnard College may penetrate still farther. I suppose that, when the
  time comes, I shall be expected to volunteer. But Professor Van
  Twiller is married, and William and Professor Smawl ought to be, and
  altogether, considering the mammoth and that gigantic and splendid
  apparition that bent from the zenith to the ocean and sent a
  tidal-wave rolling from the palm of one white hand—I say, taking all
  these various matters under consideration, I think I shall decide to
  remain in New York and continue writing for the scientific
  periodicals. Besides, the mortifying experience at the Paris
  Exposition has dampened even my perennially youthful enthusiasm. And
  as for the late expedition to Florida, Heaven knows I am ready to
  repeat it—nay, I am already forming a plan for the rescue—but though
  I am prepared to encounter any danger for the sake of my beloved
  superior, Professor Farrago, I do not feel inclined to commit
  indiscretions in order to pry into secrets which, as I regard it,
  concern Professor Smawl and William Spike alone.</p>
<p>But all this is, in a measure, premature. What I now have to relate is
  the recital of an eye-witness to that most astonishing scandal which
  occurred during the recent exposition in Paris.</p>

<p><br>
</p><p>When the delegates were appointed to the International Scientific
  Congress at the Paris Exposition of 1900, how little did anybody
  imagine that the great conference would end in the most gigantic
  scandal that ever stirred two continents?</p>
<p>Yet, had it not been for the pair of American newspapers published in
  Paris, this scandal would never have been aired, for the continental
  press is so well muzzled that when it bites its teeth merely meet in
  the empty atmosphere with a discreet snap.</p>
<p>But to the Yankee nothing excepting the Monroe Doctrine is sacred, and
  the unsopped watch-dogs of the press bite right and left, unmuzzled.
  The biter bites—it is his profession—and that ends the affair; the
  bitee is bitten, and, in the deplorable argot of the hour, "it is up
  to him."</p>
<p>So now that the scandal has been well aired and hung out to dry in the
  teeth of decency and the four winds, and as all the details have been
  cheerfully and grossly exaggerated, it is, perhaps, the proper moment
  for the truth to be written by the only person whose knowledge of all
  the facts in the affair entitles him to speak for himself as well as
  for those honorable ladies and gentlemen whose names and titles have
  been so mercilessly criticised.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>These, then, are the simple facts:</p>
<p>The International Scientific Congress, now adjourned <i>sine die</i>, met
  at nine o'clock in the morning, May 3, 1900, in the Tasmanian Pavilion
  of the Paris Exposition. There were present the most famous scientists
  of Great Britain, France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Switzerland, and the
  United States.</p>
<p>His Royal Highness the Crown-Prince of Monaco presided.</p>
<p>It is not necessary, now, to repeat the details of that preliminary
  meeting. It is sufficient to say that committees representing the
  various known sciences were named and appointed by the Prince of
  Monaco, who had been unanimously elected permanent chairman of the
  conference. It is the composition of a single committee that concerns
  us now, and that committee, representing the science which treats of
  bird life, was made up as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman—His Royal Highness the Crown-Prince of Monaco. Members—Sir
  Peter Grebe, Great Britain; Baron de Becasse, France; his Royal
  Highness King Christian, of Finland; the Countess d'Alzette, of
  Belgium; and I, from the United States, representing the Smithsonian
  Institution and the Bronx Park Zoological Society of New York.</p>
<p>This, then, was the composition of that now notorious ornithological
  committee, a modest, earnest, self-effacing little band of workers,
  bound together—in the beginning—by those ties of mutual respect and
  esteem which unite all laborers in the vineyard of science.</p>
<p>From the first meeting of our committee, science, the great leveller,
  left no artificial barriers of rank or title <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>standing between us. We
  were enthusiasts in our love for ornithology; we found new inspiration
  in the democracy of our common interests.</p>
<p>As for me, I chatted with my fellows, feeling no restraint myself and
  perceiving none. The King of Finland and I discussed his latest
  monograph on the speckled titmouse, and I was glad to agree with the
  King in all his theories concerning the nesting habits of that
  important bird.</p>
<p>Sir Peter Grebe, a large, red gentleman in tweeds, read us some notes
  he had made on the domestic hen and her reasons for running ahead of a
  horse and wagon instead of stepping aside to let the disturbing
  vehicle pass.</p>
<p>The Crown-Prince of Monaco took issue with Sir Peter; so did the Baron
  de Becasse; and we were entertained by a friendly and marvellously
  interesting three-cornered dispute, shared in by three of the most
  profound thinkers of the century.</p>
<p>I shall never forget the brilliancy of that argument, nor the modest,
  good-humored retorts which gave us all a glimpse into depths of
  erudition which impressed us profoundly and set the seal on the bonds
  which held us so closely together.</p>
<p>Alas, that the seal should ever have been broken! Alas, that the
  glittering apple of discord should have been flung into our
  midst!—no, not flung, but gently rolled under our noses by the gloved
  fingers of the lovely Countess d'Alzette.</p>
<p>"Messieurs," said the fair Countess, when all present, excepting she
  and I, had touched upon or indicated the subjects which they had
  prepared to present to the congress—"messieurs mes confrères, I have
  been requested <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>by our distinguished chairman, the Crown-Prince of
  Monaco, to submit to your judgment the subject which, by favor of the
  King of the Belgians, I have prepared to present to the International
  Scientific Congress."</p>
<p>She made a pretty courtesy as she named her own sovereign, and we all
  rose out of respect to that most austere and moral ruler the King of
  Belgium.</p>
<p>"But," she said, with a charming smile of depreciation, "I am very,
  very much afraid that the subject which I have chosen may not meet
  with your approval, gentlemen."</p>
<p>She stood there in her dainty Parisian gown and bonnet, shaking her
  pretty head uncertainly, a smile on her lips, her small, gloved
  fingers interlocked.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know how dreadful it would be if this great congress should be
  compelled to listen to any hoax like that which Monsieur de Rougemont
  imposed on the British Royal Society," she said, gravely; "and because
  the subject of my paper is as strange as the strangest phenomenon
  alleged to have been noted by Monsieur de Rougemont, I hesitate—"</p>
<p>She glanced at the silent listeners around her. Sir Peter's red face
  had hardened; the King of Finland frowned slightly; the Crown-Prince
  of Monaco and Baron de Becasse wore anxious smiles. But when her
  violet eyes met mine I gave her a glance of encouragement, and that
  glance, I am forced to confess, was not dictated by scientific
  approval, but by something that never entirely dries up in the
  mustiest and dustiest of savants—the old Adam implanted in us all.</p>
<p>Now, I knew perfectly well what her subject must be; so did every man
  present. For it was no secret that his <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>Majesty of Belgium had been
  swindled by some natives in Tasmania, and had paid a very large sum of
  money for a skin of that gigantic bird, the ux, which has been so
  often reported to exist among the inaccessible peaks of the Tasmanian
  Mountains. Needless, perhaps, to say that the skin proved a fraud,
  being nothing more than a Barnum contrivance made up out of the skins
  of a dozen ostriches and cassowaries, and most cleverly put together
  by Chinese workmen; at least, such was the report made on it by Sir
  Peter Grebe, who had been sent by the British Society to Antwerp to
  examine the acquisition. Needless, also, perhaps, to say that King
  Leopold, of Belgium, stoutly maintained that the skin of the ux was
  genuine from beak to claw.</p>
<p>For six months there had been a most serious difference of opinion
  among European ornithologists concerning the famous ux in the Antwerp
  Museum; and this difference had promised to result in an open quarrel
  between a few Belgian savants on one side and-all Europe and Great
  Britain on the other.</p>
<p>Scientists have a deep—rooted horror of anything that touches on
  charlatanism; the taint of trickery not only alarms them, but drives
  them away from any suspicious subject, and usually ruins,
  scientifically speaking, the person who has introduced the subject for
  discussion.</p>
<p>Therefore, it took no little courage for the Countess d'Alzette to
  touch, with her dainty gloves, a subject which every scientist in
  Europe, with scarcely an exception, had pronounced fraudulent and
  unworthy of investigation. And to bring it before the great
  International Congress required more courage still; for the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>person
  who could face, in executive session, the most brilliant intellects in
  the world, and openly profess faith in a Barnumized bird skin, either
  had no scientific reputation to lose or was possessed of a bravery far
  above that of the savants who composed the audience.</p>
<p>Now, when the pretty Countess caught a flash of encouragement in my
  glance she turned rosy with gratification and surprise. Clearly, she
  had not expected to find a single ally in the entire congress. Her
  quick smile of gratitude touched me, and made me ashamed, too, for I
  had encouraged her out of the pure love of mischief, hoping to hear
  the whole matter threshed before the congress and so have it settled
  once for all. It was a thoughtless thing to do on my part. I should
  have remembered the consequences to the Countess if it were proven
  that she had been championing a fraud. The ruffled dignity of the
  congress would never forgive her; her scientific career would
  practically be at an end, because her theories and observations could
  no longer command respect or even the attention of those who knew that
  she herself had once been deceived by a palpable fraud.</p>
<p>I looked at her guiltily, already ashamed of myself for encouraging
  her to her destruction. How lovely and innocent she appeared, standing
  there reading her notes in a low, clear voice, fresh as a child's,
  with now and then a delicious upward sweep of her long, dark lashes.</p>
<p>With a start I came to my senses and bestowed a pinch on myself. This
  was neither the time nor the place to sentimentalize over a girlish
  beauty whose small, Parisian head was crammed full of foolish, brave
  theories <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>concerning an imposition which her aged sovereign had been
  unable to detect.</p>
<p>I saw the gathering frown on the King of Finland's dark face; I saw
  Sir Peter Grebe grow redder and redder, and press his thick lips
  together to control the angry "Bosh!" which need not have been uttered
  to have been understood. The Baron de Becasse wore a painfully neutral
  smile, which froze his face into a quaint gargoyle; the Crown-Prince
  of Monaco looked at his polished fingernails with a startled yet
  abstracted resignation. Clearly the young Countess had not a
  sympathizer in the committee.</p>
<p>Something—perhaps it was the latent chivalry which exists imbedded in
  us all, perhaps it was pity, perhaps a glimmering dawn of belief in
  the ux skin—set my thoughts working very quickly.</p>
<p>The Countess d'Alzette finished her notes, then glanced around with a
  deprecating smile, which died out on her lips when she perceived the
  silent and stony hostility of her fellow-scientists. A quick
  expression of alarm came into her lovely eyes. Would they vote against
  giving her a hearing before the congress? It required a unanimous vote
  to reject a subject. She turned her eyes on me.</p>
<p>I rose, red as fire, my head humming with a chaos of ideas all
  disordered and vague, yet whirling along in a single, resistless
  current. I had come to the congress prepared to deliver a monograph on
  the great auk; but now the subject went overboard as the birds
  themselves had, and I found myself pleading with the committee to give
  the Countess a hearing on the ux.</p>
<p>"Why not?" I exclaimed, warmly. "It is established <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>beyond question
  that the ux does exist in Tasmania. Wallace saw several uxen, through
  his telescope, walking about upon the inaccessible heights of the
  Tasmanian Mountains. Darwin acknowledged that the bird exists;
  Professor Farrago has published a pamphlet containing an accumulation
  of all data bearing upon the ux. Why should not Madame la Comtesse be
  heard by the entire congress?"</p>
<p>I looked at Sir Peter Grebe.</p>
<p>"Have <i>you</i> seen this alleged bird skin in the Antwerp Museum?" he
  asked, perspiring with indignation.</p>
<p>"Yes, I have," said I. "It has been patched up, but how are we to know
  that the skin did not require patching? I have not found that ostrich
  skin has been used. It is true that the Tasmanians may have shot the
  bird to pieces and mended the skin with bits of cassowary hide here
  and there. But the greater part of the skin, and the beak and claws,
  are, in my estimation, well worth the serious attention of savants. To
  pronounce them fraudulent is, in my opinion, rash and premature."</p>
<p>I mopped my brow; I was in for it now. I had thrown in my reputation
  with the reputation of the Countess.</p>
<p>The displeasure and astonishment of my confrères was unmistakable. In
  the midst of a strained silence I moved that a vote be taken upon the
  advisability of a hearing before the congress on the subject of the
  ux. After a pause the young Countess, pale and determined, seconded my
  motion. The result of the balloting was a foregone conclusion; the
  Countess had one vote—she herself refraining from voting—and the
  subject was entered on the committee-book as acceptable and a date set
  for the hearing before the International Congress.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>The effect of this vote on our little committee was most marked.
  Constraint took the place of cordiality, polite reserve replaced that
  guileless and open-hearted courtesy with which our proceedings had
  begun.</p>
<p>With icy politeness, the Crown-Prince of Monaco asked me to state the
  subject of the paper I proposed to read before the congress, and I
  replied quietly that, as I was partly responsible for advocating the
  discussion of the ux, I proposed to associate myself with the Countess
  d'Alzette in that matter—if Madame la Comtesse would accept the offer
  of a brother savant.</p>
<p>"Indeed I will," she said, impulsively, her blue eyes soft with
  gratitude.</p>
<p>"Very well," observed Sir Peter Grebe, swallowing his indignation and
  waddling off towards the door; "I shall resign my position on this
  committee—yes, I will, I tell you!"—as the King of Finland laid a
  fatherly hand on Sir Peter's sleeve—"I'll not be made responsible for
  this damn—"</p>
<p>He choked, sputtered, then bowed to the horrified Countess, asking
  pardon, and declaring that he yielded to nobody in respect for the
  gentler sex. And he retired with the Baron de Becasse.</p>
<p>But out in the hallway I heard him explode. "Confound it! This is no
  place for petticoats, Baron! And as for that Yankee ornithologist,
  he's hung himself with the Countess's corset—string—yes, he has!
  Don't tell me, Baron! The young idiot was all right until the Countess
  looked at him, I tell you. Gad! how she crumpled him up with those
  blue eyes of hers! What the devil do women come into such committees
  for? Eh? It's an outrage, I tell you! Why, the whole world will <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>jeer
  at us if we sit and listen to her monograph on that fraudulent bird!"</p>
<p>The young Countess, who was writing near the window, could not have
  heard this outburst; but I heard it, and so did King Christian and the
  Crown-Prince of Monaco.</p>
<p>"Lord," thought I, "the Countess and I are in the frying-pan this
  time. I'll do what I can to keep us both out of the fire."</p>
<p>When the King and the Crown-Prince had made their adieux to the
  Countess, and she had responded, pale and serious, they came over to
  where I was standing, looking out on the Seine.</p>
<p>"Though we must differ from you," said the King, kindly, "we wish you
  all success in this dangerous undertaking."</p>
<p>I thanked him.</p>
<p>"You are a young man to risk a reputation already established,"
  remarked the Crown-Prince, then added: "You are braver than I.
  Ridicule is a barrier to all knowledge, and, though we know that, we
  seekers after truth always bring up short at that barrier and
  dismount, not daring to put our hobbies to the fence."</p>
<p>"One can but come a cropper," said I.</p>
<p>"And risk staking our hobbies? No, no, that would make us ridiculous;
  and ridicule kills in Europe."</p>
<p>"It's somewhat deadly in America, too," I said, smiling.</p>
<p>"The more honor to you," said the Crown-Prince, gravely.</p>
<p>"Oh, I am not the only one," I answered, lightly. "There is my
  confrère, Professor Hyssop, who studies <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>apparitions and braves a
  contempt and ridicule which none of us would dare challenge. We
  Yankees are learning slowly. Some day we will find the lost key to the
  future while Europe is sneering at those who are trying to pick the
  lock."</p>
<p>When King Christian, of Finland, and the Crown-Prince of Monaco had
  taken their hats and sticks and departed, I glanced across the room at
  the young Countess, who was now working rapidly on a type-writer,
  apparently quite oblivious of my presence.</p>
<p>I looked out of the window again, and my gaze wandered over the
  exposition grounds. Gilt and scarlet and azure the palaces rose in
  every direction, under a wilderness of fluttering flags. Towers,
  minarets, turrets, golden spires cut the blue sky; in the west the
  gaunt Eiffel Tower sprawled across the glittering Esplanade; behind it
  rose the solid golden dome of the Emperor's tomb, gilded once more by
  the Almighty's sun, to amuse the living rabble while the dead
  slumbered in his imperial crypt, himself now but a relic for the
  amusement of the people whom he had despised. O tempora! O mores! O
  Napoleon!</p>
<p>Down under my window, in the asphalted court, the King of Finland was
  entering his beautiful victoria. An adjutant, wearing a cocked hat and
  brilliant uniform, mounted the box beside the green-and-gold coachman;
  the two postilions straightened up in their saddles; the four horses
  danced. Then, when the Crown-Prince of Monaco had taken a seat beside
  the King, the carriage rolled away, and far down the quay I watched it
  until the flutter of the green-and-white plumes in the adjutant's
  cocked hat was all I could see of vanishing royalty.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>I was still musing there by the window, listening to the click and
  ringing of the type-writer, when I suddenly became aware that the
  clicking had ceased, and, turning, I saw the young Countess standing
  beside me.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your chivalrous impulse to help me," she said, frankly,
  holding out her bare hand.</p>
<p>I bent over it.</p>
<p>"I had not realized how desperate my case was," she said, with a
  smile. "I supposed that they would at least give me a hearing. How can
  I thank you for your brave vote in my favor?"</p>
<p>"By giving me your confidence in this matter," said I, gravely. "If we
  are to win, we must work together and work hard, madame. We are
  entering a struggle, not only to prove the genuineness of a bird skin
  and the existence of a bird which neither of us has ever seen, but
  also a struggle which will either make us famous forever or render it
  impossible for either of us ever again to face a scientific audience."</p>
<p>"I know it," she said, quietly "And I understand all the better how
  gallant a gentleman I have had the fortune to enlist in my cause.
  Believe me, had I not absolute confidence in my ability to prove the
  existence of the ux I should not, selfish as I am, have accepted your
  chivalrous offer to stand or fall with me."</p>
<p>The subtle emotion in her voice touched a responsive chord in me. I
  looked at her earnestly; she raised her beautiful eyes to mine.</p>
<p>"Will you help me?" she asked.</p>
<p>Would I help her? Faith, I'd pass the balance of my life turning
  flip-flaps to please her. I did not attempt to undeceive myself; I
  realized that the lightning had <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>struck me—that I was desperately in
  love with the young Countess from the tip of her bonnet to the toe of
  her small, polished shoe. I was curiously cool about it, too, although
  my heart gave a thump that nigh choked me, and I felt myself going red
  from temple to chin.</p>
<p>If the Countess d'Alzette noticed it she gave no sign, unless the pink
  tint under her eyes, deepening, was a subtle signal of understanding
  to the signal in my eyes.</p>
<p>"Suppose," she said, "that I failed, before the congress, to prove my
  theory? Suppose my investigations resulted in the exposure of a fraud
  and my name was held up to ridicule before all Europe? What would
  become of you, monsieur?"</p>
<p>I was silent.</p>
<p>"You are already celebrated as the discoverer of the mammoth and the
  great auk," she persisted. "You are young, enthusiastic, renowned, and
  you have a future before you that anybody in the world might envy."</p>
<p>I said nothing.</p>
<p>"And yet," she said, softly, "you risk all because you will not leave
  a young woman friendless among her confrères. It is not wise,
  monsieur; it is gallant and generous and impulsive, but it is not
  wisdom. Don Quixote rides no more in Europe, my friend."</p>
<p>"He stays at home—seventy million of him—in America," said I.</p>
<p>After a moment she said, "I believe you, monsieur."</p>
<p>"It is true enough," I said, with a laugh. "We are the only people who
  tilt at windmills these days—we and our cousins, the British, who
  taught us."</p>
<p>I bowed gayly, and added:</p>
<p>"With your colors to wear, I shall have the honor of <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>breaking a lance
  against the biggest windmill in the world."</p>
<p>"You mean the Citadel of Science," she said, smiling.</p>
<p>"And its rock-ribbed respectability," I replied.</p>
<p>She looked at me thoughtfully, rolling and unrolling the scroll in her
  hands. Then she sighed, smiled, and brightened, handing me the scroll.</p>
<p>"Read it carefully," she said; "it is an outline of the policy I
  suggest that we follow. You will be surprised at some of the
  statements. Yet every word is the truth. And, monsieur, your reward
  for the devotion you have offered will be no greater than you deserve,
  when you find yourself doubly famous for our joint monograph on the
  ux. Without your vote in the committee I should have been denied a
  hearing, even though I produced proofs to support my theory. I
  appreciate that; I do most truly appreciate the courage which prompted
  you to defend a woman at the risk of your own ruin. Come to me this
  evening at nine. I hold for you in store a surprise and pleasure which
  you do not dream of."</p>
<p>"Ah, but I do," I said, slowly, under the spell of her delicate beauty
  and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"How can you?" she said, laughing. "You don't know what awaits you at
  nine this evening?"</p>
<p>"You," I said, fascinated.</p>
<p>The color swept her face; she dropped me a deep courtesy.</p>
<p>"At nine, then," she said. "No. 8 Rue d'Alouette."</p>
<p>I bowed, took my hat, gloves, and stick, and attended her to her
  carriage below.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>Long after the blue-and-black victoria had whirled away down the
  crowded quay I stood looking after it, mazed in the web of that
  ancient enchantment whose spell fell over the first man in Eden, and
  whose sorcery shall not fail till the last man returns his soul.</p>

<p><br>
</p><p>I lunched at my lodgings on the Quai Malthus, and I had but little
  appetite, having fed upon such an unexpected variety of emotions
  during the morning.</p>
<p>Now, although I was already heels over head in love, I do not believe
  that loss of appetite was the result of that alone. I was slowly
  beginning to realize what my recent attitude might cost me, not only
  in an utter collapse of my scientific career, and the consequent
  material ruin which was likely to follow, but in the loss of all my
  friends at home. The Zoological Society of Bronx Park and the
  Smithsonian Institution of Washington had sent me as their trusted
  delegate, leaving it entirely to me to choose the subject on which I
  was to speak before the International Congress. What, then, would be
  their attitude when they learned that I had chosen to uphold the
  dangerous theory of the existence of the ux.</p>
<p>Would they repudiate me and send another delegate to replace me? Would
  they merely wash their hands of me and let me go to my own
  destruction?</p>
<p>"I will know soon enough," thought I, "for this morning's proceedings
  will have been cabled to New York ere now, and read at the
  breakfast-tables of every old, moss-grown naturalist in America before
  I see the Countess d'Alzette this evening." And I drew from my pocket
  the roll of paper which she had given me, and, lighting a cigar, lay
  back in my chair to read it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>The manuscript had been beautifully type-written, and I had no trouble
  in following her brief, clear account of the circumstances under which
  the notorious ux-skin had been obtained. As for the story itself, it
  was somewhat fishy, but I manfully swallowed my growing nervousness
  and comforted myself with the belief of Darwin in the existence of the
  ux, and the subsequent testimony of Wallace, who simply stated what he
  had seen through his telescope, and then left it to others to identify
  the enormous birds he described as he had observed them stalking about
  on the snowy peaks of the Tasmanian Alps.</p>
<p>My own knowledge of the ux was confined to a single circumstance.
  When, in 1897, I had gone to Tasmania with Professor Farrago, to make
  a report on the availability of the so-called "Tasmanian devil," as a
  substitute for the mongoose in the West Indies, I of course heard a
  great deal of talk among the natives concerning the birds which they
  affirmed haunted the summits of the mountains.</p>
<p>Our time in Tasmania was too limited to admit of an exploration then.
  But although we were perfectly aware that the summits of the Tasmanian
  Alps are inaccessible, we certainly should have attempted to gain them
  had not the time set for our departure arrived before we had completed
  the investigation for which we were sent.</p>
<p>One relic, however, I carried away with me. It was a single greenish
  bronzed feather, found high up in the mountains by a native, and sold
  to me for a somewhat large sum of money.</p>
<p>Darwin believed the ux to be covered with greenish <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>plumage; Wallace
  was too far away to observe the color of the great birds; but all the
  natives of Tasmania unite in affirming that the plumage of the ux is
  green.</p>
<p>It was not only the color of this feather that made me an eager
  purchaser, it was the extraordinary length and size. I knew of no
  living bird large enough to wear such a feather. As for the color,
  that might have been tampered with before I bought it, and, indeed,
  testing it later, I found on the fronds traces of sulphate of copper.
  But the same thing has been found in the feathers of certain birds
  whose color is metallic green, and it has been proven that such birds
  pick up and swallow shining bits of copper pyrites.</p>
<p>Why should not the ux do the same thing?</p>
<p>Still, my only reason for believing in the existence of the bird was
  this single feather. I had easily proved that it belonged to no known
  species of bird. I also proved it to be similar to the tail-feathers
  of the ux-skin in Antwerp. But the feathers on the Antwerp specimen
  were gray, and the longest of them was but three feet in length, while
  my huge, bronze-green feather measured eleven feet from tip to tip.</p>
<p>One might account for it supposing the Antwerp skin to be that of a
  young bird, or of a moulting bird, or perhaps of a different sex from
  the bird whose feather I had secured.</p>
<p>Still, these ideas were not proven. Nothing concerning the birds had
  been proven. I had but a single fact to lean on, and that was that the
  feather I possessed could not have belonged to any known species of
  bird. Nobody but myself knew of the existence of this feather. And now
  I meant to cable to Bronx Park for it, and to <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>place this evidence at
  the disposal of the beautiful Countess d'Alzette.</p>
<p>My cigar had gone out, as I sat musing, and I relighted it and resumed
  my reading of the type-written notes, lazily, even a trifle
  sceptically, for all the evidence that she had been able to collect to
  substantiate her theory of the existence of the ux was not half as
  important as the evidence I was to produce in the shape of that
  enormous green feather.</p>
<p>I came to the last paragraph, smoking serenely, and leaning back
  comfortably, one leg crossed over the other. Then, suddenly, my
  attention became riveted on the words under my eyes. Could I have read
  them aright? Could I believe what I read in ever-growing astonishment
  which culminated in an excitement that stirred the very hair on my
  head?</p>
<div class="block2"><p>"The ux exists. There is no longer room for doubt. Ocular
  proof I can now offer in the shape of <i>five living eggs</i> of
  this gigantic bird. All measures have been taken to hatch
  these eggs; they are now in the vast incubator. It is my plan
  to have them hatch, one by one, under the very eyes of the
  International Congress. It will be the greatest triumph that
  science has witnessed since the discovery of the New World.</p>
  <p class="right">[Signed] "<span class="sc">Susanne d'Alzette</span>."</p>
</div>
<p>"Either," I cried out, in uncontrollable excitement—"either that girl
  is mad or she is the cleverest woman on earth."</p>
<p>After a moment I added:</p>
<p>"In either event I am going to marry her."</p>

</p><h3>XI<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc" class="pginternal">ToC</a></span></h3>
<p><br>
</p><p>That evening, a few minutes before nine o'clock, I descended from a
  cab in front of No. 8 Rue d'Alouette, and was ushered into a pretty
  reception-room by an irreproachable servant, who disappeared directly
  with my card.</p>
<p>In a few moments the young Countess came in, exquisite in her silvery
  dinner-gown, eyes bright, white arms extended in a charming, impulsive
  welcome. The touch of her silky fingers thrilled me; I was dumb under
  the enchantment of her beauty; and I think she understood my silence,
  for her blue eyes became troubled and the happy parting of her lips
  changed to a pensive curve.</p>
<p>Presently I began to tell her about my bronzed-green feather; at my
  first word she looked up brightly, almost gratefully, I fancied; and
  in another moment we were deep in eager discussion of the subject
  which had first drawn us together.</p>
<p>What evidence I possessed to sustain our theory concerning the
  existence of the ux I hastened to reveal; then, heart beating
  excitedly, I asked her about the eggs and where they were at present,
  and whether she believed it possible to bring them to Paris—all these
  questions in the same breath—which brought a happy light into her
  eyes and a delicious ripple of laughter to her lips.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>"Why, of course it is possible to bring the eggs here," she cried. "Am
  I sure? Parbleu! The eggs are already here, monsieur!"</p>
<p>"Here!" I exclaimed. "In Paris?"</p>
<p>"In Paris? Mais oui; and in my own house—<i>this very house</i>, monsieur.
  Come, you shall behold them with your own eyes!"</p>
<p>Her eyes were brilliant with excitement; impulsively she stretched out
  her rosy hand. I took it; and she led me quickly back through the
  drawing-room, through the dining-room, across the butler's pantry, and
  into a long, dark hallway. We were almost running now—I keeping tight
  hold of her soft little hand, she, raising her gown a trifle, hurrying
  down the hallway, silken petticoats rustling like a silk banner in the
  wind. A turn to the right brought us to the cellar-stairs; down we
  hastened, and then across the cemented floor towards a long,
  glass-fronted shelf, pierced with steam-pipes.</p>
<p>"A match," she whispered, breathlessly.</p>
<p>I struck a wax match and touched it to the gas-burner overhead.</p>
<p>Never, never can I forget what that flood of gas-light revealed. In a
  row stood five large, glass-mounted incubators; behind the glass doors
  lay, in dormant majesty, five enormous eggs. The eggs were
  pale-green—lighter, somewhat, than robins' eggs, but not as pale as
  herons' eggs. Each egg appeared to be larger than a large hogs-head,
  and was partly embedded in bales of cotton-wool.</p>
<p>Five little silver thermometers inside the glass doors indicated a
  temperature of 95° Fahrenheit. I noticed that there was an automatic
  arrangement connected with the pipes which regulated the temperature.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>I was too deeply moved for words. Speech seemed superfluous as we
  stood there, hand in hand, contemplating those gigantic, pale-green
  eggs.</p>
<p>There is something in a silent egg which moves one's deeper
  emotions—something solemn in its embryotic inertia, something awesome
  in its featureless immobility.</p>
<p>I know of nothing on earth which is so totally lacking in expression
  as an egg. The great desert Sphinx, brooding through its veil of sand,
  has not that tremendous and meaningless dignity which wraps the
  colorless oval effort of a single domestic hen.</p>
<p>I held the hand of the young Countess very tightly. Her fingers closed
  slightly.</p>
<p>Then and there, in the solemn presence of those emotionless eggs, I
  placed my arm around her supple waist and kissed her.</p>
<p>She said nothing. Presently she stooped to observe the thermometer.
  Naturally, it registered 95° Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>"Susanne," I said, softly.</p>
<p>"Oh, we must go up-stairs," she whispered, breathlessly; and, picking
  up her silken skirts, she fled up the cellar-stairs.</p>
<p>I turned out the gas, with that instinct of economy which early
  wastefulness has implanted in me, and followed the Countess Suzanne
  through the suite of rooms and into the small reception-hall where she
  had first received me.</p>
<p>She was sitting on a low divan, head bent, slowly turning a sapphire
  ring on her finger, round and round.</p>
<p>I looked at her romantically, and then—</p>
<p>"Please don't," she said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>The correct reply to this is:</p>
<p>"Why not?"—very tenderly spoken.</p>
<p>"Because," she replied, which was also the correct and regular answer.</p>
<p>"Suzanne," I said, slowly and passionately.</p>
<p>She turned the sapphire ring on her finger. Presently she tired of
  this, so I lifted her passive hand very gently and continued turning
  the sapphire ring on her finger, slowly, to harmonize with the cadence
  of our unspoken thoughts.</p>
<p>Towards midnight I went home, walking with great care through a new
  street in Paris, paved exclusively with rose-colored blocks of air.</p>

</p><h3>XII<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc" class="pginternal">ToC</a></span></h3>
<p><br>
</p><p>At nine o'clock in the evening, July 31, 1900, the International
  Congress was to assemble in the great lecture-hall of the Belgian
  Scientific Pavilion, which adjourned the Tasmanian Pavilion, to hear
  the Countess Suzanne d'Alzette read her paper on the ux.</p>
<p>That morning the Countess and I, with five furniture vans, had
  transported the five great incubators to the platform of the
  lecture-hall, and had engaged an army of plumbers and gas-fitters to
  make the steam-heating connections necessary to maintain in the
  incubators a temperature of 100° Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>A heavy green curtain hid the stage from the body of the lecture-hall.
  Behind this curtain the five enormous eggs reposed, each in its
  incubator.</p>
<p>The Countess Suzanne was excited and calm by turns, her cheeks were
  pink, her lips scarlet, her eyes bright as blue planets at midnight.</p>
<p>Without faltering she rehearsed her discourse before me, reading from
  her type-written manuscript in a clear voice, in which I could
  scarcely discern a tremor. Then we went through the dumb show of
  exhibiting the uxen eggs to a frantically applauding audience; she
  responded to countless supposititious encores, I leading her out
  repeatedly before the green curtain to face the great, damp, darkened
  auditorium.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>Then, in response to repeated imaginary recalls, she rehearsed the
  extemporaneous speech, thanking the distinguished audience for their
  patience in listening to an unknown confrère, and confessing her
  obligations to me (here I appeared and bowed in self-abasement) for my
  faith in her and my aid in securing for her a public hearing before
  the most highly educated audience in the world.</p>
<p>After that we retired behind the curtain to sit on an empty box and
  eat sandwiches and watch the last lingering plumbers pasting up the
  steam connections with a pot of molten lead.</p>
<p>The plumbers were Americans, brought to Paris to make repairs on the
  American buildings during the exposition, and we conversed with them
  affably as they pottered about, plumber-like, poking under the
  flooring with lighted candles, rubbing their thumbs up and down musty
  old pipes, and prying up planks in dark corners.</p>
<p>They informed us that they were union men and that they hoped we were
  too. And I replied that union was certainly my ultimate purpose, at
  which the young Countess smiled dreamily at vacancy.</p>
<p>We did not dare leave the incubators. The plumbers lingered on, hour
  after hour, while we sat and watched the little silver thermometers,
  and waited.</p>
<p>It was time for the Countess Suzanne to dress, and still the plumbers
  had not finished; so I sent a messenger for her maid, to bring her
  trunk to the lecture-hall, and I despatched another messenger to my
  lodgings for my evening clothes and fresh linen.</p>
<p>There were several dressing-rooms off the stage. Here, about six
  o'clock, the Countess retired with her maid, to <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>dress, leaving me to
  watch the plumbers and the thermometers.</p>
<p>When the Countess Suzanne returned, radiant and lovely in an evening
  gown of black lace, I gave her the roses I had brought for her and
  hurried off to dress in my turn, leaving her to watch the
  thermometers.</p>
<p>I was not absent more than half an hour, but when I returned I found
  the Countess anxiously conversing with the plumbers and pointing
  despairingly at the thermometers, which now registered only 95°.</p>
<p>"You must keep up the temperature!" I said. "Those eggs are due to
  hatch within a few hours. What's the trouble with the heat?"</p>
<p>The plumber did not know, but thought the connections were defective.</p>
<p>"But that's why we called you in!" exclaimed the Countess. "Can't you
  fix things securely?"</p>
<p>"Oh, we'll fix things, lady," replied the plumber, condescendingly,
  and he ambled away to rub his thumb up and down a pipe.</p>
<p>As we alone were unable to move and handle the enormous eggs, the
  Countess, whose sweet character was a stranger to vindictiveness or
  petty resentment, had written to the members of the ornithological
  committee, revealing the marvellous fortune which had crowned her
  efforts in the search for evidence to sustain her theory concerning
  the ux, and inviting these gentlemen to aid her in displaying the
  great eggs to the assembled congress.</p>
<p>This she had done the night previous. Every one of the gentlemen
  invited had come post-haste to her "hotel," to view the eggs with
  their own sceptical and <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>astonished eyes; and the fair young Countess
  and I tasted our first triumph in her cellar, whither we conducted Sir
  Peter Grebe, the Crown-Prince of Monaco, Baron de Becasse, and his
  Majesty King Christian of Finland.</p>
<p>Scepticism and incredulity gave place to excitement and unbounded
  enthusiasm. The old King embraced the Countess; Baron de Becasse
  attempted to kiss me; Sir Peter Grebe made a handsome apology for his
  folly and vowed that he would do open penance for his sins. The poor
  Crown-Prince, who was of a nervous temperament, sat on the
  cellar-stairs and wept like a child.</p>
<p>His grief at his own pig-headedness touched us all profoundly.</p>
<p>So it happened that these gentlemen were coming to-night to give their
  aid to us in moving the priceless eggs, and lend their countenance and
  enthusiastic support to the young Countess in her maiden effort.</p>
<p>Sir Peter Grebe arrived first, all covered with orders and
  decorations, and greeted us affectionately, calling the Countess the
  "sweetest lass in France," and me his undutiful Yankee cousin who had
  landed feet foremost at the expense of the British Empire.</p>
<p>The King of Finland, the Crown-Prince, and Baron de Becasse arrived
  together, a composite mass of medals, sashes, and academy palms. To
  see them moving boxes about, straightening chairs, and pulling out
  rugs reminded me of those golden-embroidered gentlemen who run out
  into the arena and roll up carpets after the acrobats have finished
  their turn in the Nouveau Cirque.</p>
<p>I was aiding the King of Finland to move a heavy <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>keg of nails, when
  the Countess called out to me in alarm, saying that the thermometers
  had dropped to 80° Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>I spoke sharply to the plumbers, who were standing in a circle behind
  the dressing-rooms; but they answered sullenly that they could do no
  more work that day.</p>
<p>Indignant and alarmed, I ordered them to come out to the stage, and,
  after some hesitation, they filed out, a sulky, silent lot of workmen,
  with their tools already gathered up and tied in their kits. At once I
  noticed that a new man had appeared among them—a red-faced, stocky
  man wearing a frock-coat and a shiny silk hat.</p>
<p>"Who is the master-workman here?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I am," said a man in blue overalls.</p>
<p>"Well," said I, "why don't you fix those steam-fittings?"</p>
<p>There was a silence. The man in the silk hat smirked.</p>
<p>"Well?" said I.</p>
<p>"Come, come, that's all right," said the man in the silk hat. "These
  men know their business without you tellin' them."</p>
<p>"Who are you?" I demanded, sharply.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm just a walkin' delegate," he replied, with a sneer. "There's
  a strike in New York and I come over here to tie this here exposition
  up. See?"</p>
<p>"You mean to say you won't let these men finish their work?" I asked,
  thunderstruck.</p>
<p>"That's about it, young man," he said, coolly.</p>
<p>Furious, I glanced at my watch, then at the thermometers, which now
  registered only 75°. Already I could hear the first-comers of the
  audience arriving in <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>the body of the hall. Already a stage-hand was
  turning up the footlights and dragging chairs and tables hither and
  thither.</p>
<p>"What will you take to stay and attend to those steam-pipes?" I
  demanded, desperately.</p>
<p>"It can't be done nohow," observed the man in the silk hat. "That New
  York strike is good for a month yet." Then, turning to the workmen, he
  nodded and, to my horror, the whole gang filed out after him, turning
  deaf ears to my entreaties and threats.</p>
<p>There was a deathly silence, then Sir Peter exploded into a vivid
  shower of words. The Countess, pale as a ghost, gave me a
  heart-breaking look. The Crown-Prince wept.</p>
<p>"Great Heaven!" I cried; "the thermometers have fallen to 70°!"</p>
<p>The King of Finland sat down on a chair and pressed his hands over his
  eyes. Baron de Becasse ran round and round, uttering subdued and
  plaintive screams; Sir Peter swore steadily.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen," I cried, desperately, "we must save those eggs! They are
  on the very eve of hatching! Who will volunteer?"</p>
<p>"To do what?" moaned the Crown-Prince.</p>
<p>"I'll show you," I exclaimed, running to the incubators and beckoning
  to the Baron to aid me.</p>
<p>In a moment we had rolled out the great egg, made a nest on the stage
  floor with the bales of cotton-wool, and placed the egg in it. One
  after another we rolled out the remaining eggs, building for each its
  nest of cotton; and at last the five enormous eggs lay there in a row
  behind the green curtain.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>"Now," said I, excitedly, to the King, "you must get up on that egg
  and try to keep it warm."</p>
<p>The King began to protest, but I would take no denial, and presently
  his Majesty was perched up on the great egg, gazing foolishly about at
  the others, who were now all climbing up on their allotted eggs.</p>
<p>"Great Heaven!" muttered the King, as Sir Peter settled down
  comfortably on his egg, "I am willing to give life and fortune for the
  sake of science, but I can't bear to hatch out eggs like a bird!"</p>
<p>The Crown-Prince was now sitting patiently beside the Baron de
  Becasse.</p>
<p>"I feel in my bones," he murmured, "that I'm about to hatch something.
  Can't you hear a tapping on the shell of your egg, Baron?"</p>
<p>"Parbleu!" replied the Baron. "The shell is moving under me."</p>
<p>It certainly was; for, the next moment, the Baron fell into his egg
  with a crash and a muffled shriek, and floundered out, dripping,
  yellow as a canary.</p>
<p>"N'importe!" he cried, excitedly. "Allons! Save the eggs! Hurrah! Vive
  la science!" And he scrambled up on the fourth egg and sat there, arms
  folded, sublime courage transfiguring him from head to foot.</p>
<p>We all gave him a cheer, which was hushed as the stage-manager ran in,
  warning us that the audience was already assembled and in place.</p>
<p>"You're not going to raise the curtain while we're sitting, are you?"
  demanded the King of Finland, anxiously.</p>
<p>"No, no," I said; "sit tight, your Majesty. Courage, gentlemen! Our
  vindication is at hand!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>The Countess glanced at me with startled eyes; I took her hand,
  saluted it respectfully, and then quietly led her before the curtain,
  facing an ocean of upturned faces across the flaring footlights.</p>
<p>She stood a moment to acknowledge the somewhat ragged applause, a calm
  smile on her lips. All her courage had returned; I saw that at once.</p>
<p>Very quietly she touched her lips to the <i>eau-sucrée</i>, laid her
  manuscript on the table, raised her beautiful head, and began:</p>
<p>"That the ux is a living bird I am here before you to prove—"</p>
<p>A sharp report behind the curtain drowned her voice. She paled; the
  audience rose amid cries of excitement.</p>
<p>"What was it?" she asked, faintly.</p>
<p>"Sir Peter has hatched out his egg," I whispered. "Hark! There goes
  another egg!" And I ran behind the curtain.</p>
<p>Such a scene as I beheld was never dreamed of on land or sea. Two
  enormous young uxen, all over gigantic pin-feathers, were wandering
  stupidly about. Mounted on one was Sir Peter Grebe, eyes starting from
  his apoplectic visage; on the other, clinging to the bird's neck, hung
  the Baron de Becasse.</p>
<p>Before I could move, the two remaining eggs burst, and a pair of huge,
  scrawny fledglings rose among the débris, bearing off on their backs
  the King and Crown-Prince.</p>
<p>"Help!" said the King of Finland, faintly. "I'm falling off!"</p>
<p>I sprang to his aid, but tripped on the curtain-spring. The next
  instant the green curtain shot up, and there, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>revealed to that vast
  and distinguished audience, roamed four enormous chicks, bearing on
  their backs the most respected and exclusive aristocracy of Europe.</p>
<p>The Countess Suzanne turned with a little shriek of horror, then sat
  down in her chair, laid her lovely head on the table, and very quietly
  fainted away, unconscious of the frantic cheers which went roaring to
  the roof.</p>
<hr style="width: 15%; padding-top: 1.25em; padding-bottom: 1.25em;">
<p>This, then, is the <i>true</i> history of the famous exposition scandal.
  And, as I have said, had it not been for the presence in that audience
  of two American reporters nobody would have known what all the world
  now knows—nobody would have read of the marvellous feats of bareback
  riding indulged in by the King of Finland—nobody would have read how
  Sir Peter Grebe steered his mount safely past the footlights only to
  come to grief over the prompter's box.</p>
<p>But this <i>is</i> scandal. And, as for the charming Countess Suzanne
  d'Alzette, the public has heard all that it is entitled to hear, and
  much that it is not entitled to hear.</p>
<p>However, on second thoughts, perhaps the public is entitled to hear a
  little more. I will therefore say this much—the shock of astonishment
  which stunned me when the curtain flew up, revealing the
  King-bestridden uxen, was nothing to the awful blow which smote me
  when the Count d'Alzette leaped from the orchestra, over the
  footlights, and bore away with him the fainting form of his wife, the
  lovely Countess d'Alzette.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder—but, as I have repeatedly observed, this dull and
  pedantic narrative of fact is no vehicle for sentimental soliloquy. It
  is, then, merely <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>sufficient to say that I took the earliest steamer
  for kinder shores, spurred on to haste by a venomous cable-gram from
  the Smithsonian, repudiating me, and by another from Bronx Park,
  ordering me to spend the winter in some inexpensive, poisonous, and
  unobtrusive spot, and make a collection of isopods. The island of Java
  appeared to me to be as poisonously unobtrusive and inexpensive a
  region as I had ever heard of; a steamer sailed from Antwerp for
  Batavia in twenty-four hours. Therefore, as I say, I took the
  night-train for Brussels, and the steamer from Antwerp the following
  evening.</p>
<p>Of my uneventful voyage, of the happy and successful quest, there is
  little to relate. The Javanese are frolicsome and hospitable. There
  was a girl there with features that were as delicate as though
  chiselled out of palest amber; and I remember she wore a most
  wonderful jewelled, helmet-like head-dress, and jingling bangles on
  her ankles, and when she danced she made most graceful and poetic
  gestures with her supple wrists—but that has nothing to do with
  isopods, absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>Letters from home came occasionally. Professor Farrago had returned to
  the Bronx and had been re-elected to the high office he had so nobly
  held when I first became associated with him.</p>
<p>Through his kindness and by his advice I remained for several years in
  the Far East, until a letter from him arrived recalling me and also
  announcing his own hurried and sudden departure for Florida. He also
  mentioned my promotion to the office of subcurator of department; so I
  started on my homeward voyage very <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>much pleased with the world, and
  arrived in New York on April 1, 1904, ready for a rest to which I
  believed myself entitled. And the first thing that they handed me was
  a letter from Professor Farrago, summoning me South.</p>

<p><br>
</p><p>The letter that started me—I was going to say startled me, but only
  imaginative people are startled—the letter, then, that started me
  from Bronx Park to the South I print without the permission of my
  superior, Professor Farrago. I have not obtained his permission, for
  the somewhat exciting reason that nobody knows where he is. Publicity
  being now recognized as the annihilator of mysteries, a benevolent
  purpose alone inspires me to publish a letter so strange, so
  pathetically remarkable, in view of what has recently occurred.</p>
<p>As I say, I had only just returned from Java with a valuable
  collection of undescribed isopods—an order of edriophthalmous
  crustaceans with seven free thoracic somites furnished with fourteen
  legs—and I beg my reader's pardon, but my reader will see the
  necessity for the author's absolute accuracy in insisting on detail,
  because the story that follows is a dangerous story for a scientist to
  tell, in view of the vast amount of nonsense and fiction in
  circulation masquerading as stories of scientific adventure.</p>
<p>I was, therefore, anticipating a delightful summer's work with pen and
  microscope, when on April 1st I received the following extraordinary
  letter from Professor Farrago:</p>
<div class="block2"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
  <p class="right">"<span class="sc">In Camp, Little Sprite Lake</span>,<br>
    "<span class="sc">Everglades, Florida</span>, <i>March 15, 1902.</i></p>
  <p>"<span class="sc">My Dear Mr. Gilland</span>,—On receipt of this
    communication you will immediately secure for me the following
    articles:</p>
  <p class="noin" style="margin-left: 1em;">"One complete outfit of woman's clothing.<br>
    "One camera.<br>
    "One light steel cage, large enough for you to stand in.<br>
    "One stenographer (male sex).<br>
    "One five-pound steel tank, with siphon and hose attachment.<br>
    "One rifle and ammunition.<br>
    "Three ounces rosium oxyde.<br>
    "One ounce chlorate strontium.</p>
  <p>"You will then, within twenty-four hours, set out with the
    stenographer and the supplies mentioned and join me in camp on
    Little Sprite Lake. This order is formal and admits of no
    delay. You will appreciate the necessity of absolute and
    unquestioning obedience when I tell you that I am practically
    on the brink of the most astonishing discovery recorded in
    natural history since Monsieur Zani discovered the
    purple-spotted zoombok in Nyanza; and that I depend upon you
    and your zeal and fidelity for success.</p>
  <p>"I dare not, lest my letter fall into unscrupulous hands,
    convey to you more than a hint of what lies before us in these
    uncharted solitudes of the Everglades.</p>
  <p>"You must read between the lines when I say that because one
    can see through a sheet of glass, the glass is none the less
    solid and palpable. One can see <i>through</i> it—if that is also
    seeing it; but one can nevertheless hold it and feel it and
    receive from it sensations of cold or heat according to its
    temperature.</p>
  <p>"Certain jellyfish are absolutely transparent when in the
    water, and one can only know of their presence by accidental
    contact, not by sight.</p>
  <p>"<i>Have you ever thought that possibly there might exist larger
    and more highly organized creatures transparent to eyesight,
    yet palpable to touch?</i></p>
  <p>"Little Sprite Lake is the jumping-off place; beyond lie the
    Everglades, the outskirts of which are haunted by the
    Seminoles, the interior of which have never been visited by
    man, as far as we know.</p>
  <p>"As you are aware, no general survey of Florida has yet been
    made; there exist no maps of the Everglades south of
    Okeechobee; even Little Sprite Lake is but a vague blot on our
    maps. We know, of course, that south of the eleven thousand
    square <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>miles of fresh water which is called Lake Okeechobee
    the Everglades form a vast, delta-like projection of thousands
    and thousands of square miles. Darkest Africa is no longer a
    mystery; but the Everglades to-day remain the sombre secret of
    our continent. And, to-day, this unknown expanse of swamps,
    barrens, forests, and lagoons is greater than in the days of
    De Soto, because the entire region has been slowly rising.</p>
  <p>"All this, my dear sir, you already know, and I ask your
    indulgence for recalling the facts to your memory. I do it for
    this reason—the search for <i>what I am seeking</i> may lead us to
    utter destruction; and therefore my formal orders to you
    should be modified to this extent:—do you volunteer? If you
    volunteer, my orders remain; if not, turn this letter over to
    Mr. Kingsley, who will find for me the companion I require.</p>
  <p>"In the event of your coming, you must break your journey at
    False Cape and ask for an old man named Slunk. He will give
    you a packet; you will give him a dollar, and drive on to Cape
    Canaveral, and you will do what is to be done there. From
    there to Fort Kissimmee, to Okeechobee, traversing the lake to
    the Rita River, where I have marked the trail to Little
    Sprite.</p>
  <p>"At Little Sprite I shall await you; beyond that point a
    merciful Providence alone can know what awaits us.</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 15%;">"Yours fraternally,</p>
  <p class="right sc">"Farrago.</p>
  <p>"P.S.—I think that you had better make your will, and suggest
    the same idea to the stenographer who is to accompany you.
    F."</p>
</div>
<p>And that was the letter I received while seated comfortably on the
  floor of my work-room, surrounded by innocent isopods, all patiently
  awaiting scientific investigation.</p>
<p>And this is what I did: Within twenty-four hours I had assembled the
  supplies required—the cage, the woman's clothing, tank, arms and
  ammunition, and the chemicals; I had secured accommodations, for that
  evening, on the Florida, Volusia, and Fort Lauderdale Railway as far
  as Citron City; and I had been interviewing <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>stenographers all day
  long, the result of an innocently worded advertisement in the daily
  newspapers.</p>
<p>It was now very close to the time when I must summon a cab and drive
  to the ferry; and yet I was still shy one stenographer.</p>
<p>I had seen scores; they simply would not listen to the proposition.
  "Why does a gentleman in the backwoods of Florida want a
  stenographer?" they demanded; and as I had not the faintest idea, I
  could only say so. I think the majority interviewed concluded I had
  escaped from a State institution.</p>
<p>As the time for departure approached I became desperate, urging and
  beseeching applicants to accompany me; but neither sympathy for my
  instant need nor desire for salary moved them.</p>
<p>I waited until the last moment, hoping against hope. Then, with a
  groan of despair, I seized luggage and raincoat, made for the door and
  flung it open, only to find myself face to face with an attractive
  young girl, apparently on the point of pressing the electric button.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry," I said, "but I have a train to catch."</p>
<p>She was noticeably attractive in her storm-coat and pretty hat, and I
  really was sorry—so sorry that I added:</p>
<p>"I have about twenty-seven seconds to place at your service before I
  go."</p>
<p>"Twenty will be sufficient," she replied, pleasantly. "I saw your
  advertisement for a stenographer—"</p>
<p>"We require a man," I interposed, hastily.</p>
<p>"Have you engaged him?"</p>
<p>"N-no."</p>
<p>We looked at each other.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>"You wouldn't accept, anyway," I began.</p>
<p>"How do you know?"</p>
<p>"You wouldn't leave town, would you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, if you required it."</p>
<p>"What? Go to Florida?"</p>
<p>"Y-yes—if I must."</p>
<p>"But think of the alligators! Think of the snakes—big, bitey snakes!"</p>
<p>"Gracious!" she exclaimed, eyes growing bigger.</p>
<p>"Indians, too!—unreconciled, sulky Seminoles! Fevers! Mud-puddles!
  Spiders! And only fifty dollars a week—"</p>
<p>"I—I'll go," she stammered.</p>
<p>"Go?" I repeated, grimly; "then you've exactly two and three-quarter
  seconds left for preparations."</p>
<p>Instinctively she raised her little gloved hand and patted her hair.
  "I'm ready," she said, unsteadily.</p>
<p>"One extra second to make your will," I added, stunned by her
  self-possession.</p>
<p>"I—I have nothing to leave—nobody to leave it to," she said,
  smiling; "I am ready."</p>
<p>I took that extra second myself for a lightning course in reflection
  upon effects and consequences.</p>
<p>"It's silly, it's probably murder," I said, "but you're engaged! Now
  we must run for it!"</p>
<p>And that is how I came to engage the services of Miss Helen Barrison
  as stenographer.</p>
<p><br>

</p><h3>XIV<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc" class="pginternal">ToC</a></span></h3>
<p><br>
</p><p>At noon on the second day I disembarked from the train at Citron City
  with all paraphernalia—cage, chemicals, arsenal, and stenographer; an
  accumulation of very dusty impedimenta—all but the stenographer. By
  three o'clock our hotel livery-rig was speeding along the beach at
  False Cape towards the tall lighthouse looming above the dunes.</p>
<p>The abode of a gentleman named Slunk was my goal. I sat brooding in
  the rickety carriage, still dazed by the rapidity of my flight from
  New York; the stenographer sat beside me, blue eyes bright with
  excitement, fair hair blowing in the sea-wind.</p>
<p>Our railway companionship had been of the slightest, also absolutely
  formal; for I was too absorbed in conjecturing the meaning of this
  journey to be more than absent-mindedly civil; and she, I fancy, had
  had time for repentance and perhaps for a little fright, though I
  could discover traces of neither.</p>
<p>I remember she left the train at some city or other where we were held
  for an hour; and out of the car-window I saw her returning with a
  brand-new grip sack.</p>
<p>She must have bought clothes, for she continued to remain cool and
  fresh in her summer shirt-waists and short outing skirt; and she
  looked immaculate now, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>sitting there beside me, the trace of a smile
  curving her red mouth.</p>
<p>"I'm looking for a personage named Slunk," I observed.</p>
<p>After a moment's silent consideration of the Atlantic Ocean she said,
  "When do my duties begin, Mr. Gilland?"</p>
<p>"The Lord alone knows," I replied, grimly. "Are you repenting of your
  bargain?"</p>
<p>"I am quite happy," she said, serenely.</p>
<p>Remorse smote me that I had consented to engage this frail,
  pink-and-ivory biped for an enterprise which lay outside the suburbs
  of Manhattan. I glanced guiltily at my victim; she sat there, the
  incarnation of New York piquancy—a translated denizen of the
  metropolis—a slender spirit of the back offices of sky-scrapers. Why
  had I lured her hither?—here where the heavy, lavender-tinted
  breakers thundered on a lost coast; here where above the dune-jungles
  vultures soared, and snowy-headed eagles, hulking along the sands,
  tore dead fish and yelped at us as we passed.</p>
<p>Strange waters, strange skies—a strange, lost land aquiver under an
  exotic sun; and there she sat with her wise eyes of a child,
  unconcerned, watching the world in perfect confidence.</p>
<p>"May I pay a little compliment to your pluck?" I asked, amused.</p>
<p>"Certainly," she said, smiling as the maid of Manhattan alone knows
  how to smile—shyly, inquiringly—with a lingering hint of laughter in
  the curled lips' corners. Then her sensitive features fell a trifle.
  "Not pluck," she said, "but necessity; I had no chance to choose, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>no
  time to wait. My last dollar, Mr. Gilland, is in my purse!"</p>
<p>With a gay little gesture she drew it from her shirt-front, then,
  smiling, sat turning it over and over in her lap.</p>
<p>The sun fell on her hands, gilding the smooth skin with the first tint
  of sunburn. Under the corners of her eyes above the rounded cheeks a
  pink stain lay like the first ripening flush on a wild strawberry.
  That, too, was the mark left by the caress of wind and sun. I had had
  no idea she was so pretty.</p>
<p>"I think we'll enjoy this adventure," I said; "don't you?"</p>
<p>"I try to make the best of things," she said, gazing off into the
  horizon haze. "Look," she added; "is that a man?"</p>
<p>A spot far away on the beach caught my eye. At first I thought it was
  a pelican—and small wonder, too, for the dumpy, waddling,
  goose-necked individual who loomed up resembled a heavy bottomed bird
  more than a human being.</p>
<p>"Do you suppose that could be Mr. Slunk?" asked the stenographer, as
  our vehicle drew nearer.</p>
<p>He looked as though his name ought to be Slunk; he was digging coquina
  clams, and he dug with a pecking motion like a water-turkey mastering
  a mullet too big for it.</p>
<p>His name was Slunk; he admitted it when I accused him. Our negro
  driver drew rein, and I descended to the sand and gazed on Mr. Slunk.</p>
<p>He was, as I have said, not impressive, even with the tremendous
  background of sky and ocean.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>"I've come something over a thousand miles to see you," I said,
  reluctant to admit that I had come as far to see such a specimen of
  human architecture.</p>
<p>A weather-beaten grin stretched the skin that covered his face, and he
  shoved a hairy paw into the pockets of his overalls, digging deeply
  into profound depths. First he brought to light a twist of South
  Carolina tobacco, which he leisurely inserted in his mouth—not,
  apparently, for pleasure, but merely to get rid of it.</p>
<p>The second object excavated from the overalls was a small packet
  addressed to me. This he handed to me; I gravely handed him a silver
  dollar; he went back to his clam-digging, and I entered the carriage
  and drove on. All had been carried out according to the letter of my
  instructions so far, and my spirits brightened.</p>
<p>"If you don't mind I'll read my instructions," I said, in high
  good-humor.</p>
<p>"Pray do not hesitate," she said, smiling in sympathy.</p>
<p>So I opened the little packet and read:</p>
<div class="block2"><p>"Drive to Cape Canaveral along the beach. You will find a gang
  of men at work on a government breakwater. The superintendent
  is Mr. Rowan. Show him this letter.</p>
  <p class="right sc">"Farrago."</p>
</div>
<p>Rather disappointed—for I had been expecting to find in the packet
  some key to the interesting mystery which had sent Professor Farrago
  into the Everglades—I thrust the missive into my pocket and resumed a
  study of the immediate landscape. It had not changed as we progressed:
  ocean, sand, low dunes crowned with impenetrable tangles of wild bay,
  sparkleberry, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>live-oak, with here and there a weather-twisted
  palmetto sprawling, and here and there the battered blades of cactus
  and Spanish-bayonet thrust menacingly forward; and over all the
  vultures, sailing, sailing—some mere circling motes lost in the blue
  above, some sheering the earth so close that their swiftly sweeping
  shadows slanted continually across our road.</p>
<p>"I detest a buzzard," I said, aloud.</p>
<p>"I thought they were crows," she confessed.</p>
<p>"Carrion-crows—yes.</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">"'The carrion-crows<br></span>
  <span class="i0">  Sing, Caw! caw!'<br></span>
</div></div>
<p class="noin">—only they don't," I added, my song putting me in good-humor once
  more. And I glanced askance at the pretty stenographer.</p>
<p>"It is a pleasure to be employed by agreeable people," she said,
  innocently.</p>
<p>"Oh, I can be much more agreeable than that," I said.</p>
<p>"Is Professor Farrago—amusing?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Well—oh, certainly—but not in—in the way I am."</p>
<p>Suddenly it flashed upon me that my superior was a confirmed hater of
  unmarried women. I had clean forgotten it; and now the full import of
  what I had done scared me silent.</p>
<p>"Is anything the matter?" asked Miss Barrison.</p>
<p>"No—not yet," I said, ominously.</p>
<p>How on earth could I have overlooked that well-known fact. The hurry
  and anxiety, the stress of instant preparation and departure, had
  clean driven it from my absent-minded head.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>Jogging on over the sand, I sat silent, cudgelling my brains for a
  solution of the disastrous predicament I had gotten into. I pictured
  the astonished rage of my superior—my probable dismissal from
  employment—perhaps the general overturning and smash-up of the entire
  expedition.</p>
<p>A distant, dark object on the beach concentrated my distracted
  thoughts; it must be the breakwater at Cape Canaveral. And it was the
  breakwater, swarming with negro workmen, who were swinging great
  blocks of coquina into cemented beds, singing and whistling at their
  labor.</p>
<p>I forgot my predicament when I saw a thin white man in sun-helmet and
  khaki directing the work from the beach; and as our horses plodded up,
  I stepped out and hailed him by name.</p>
<p>"Yes, my name is Rowan," he said, instantly, turning to meet me. His
  sharp, clear eyes included the vehicle and the stenographer, and he
  lifted his helmet, then looked squarely at me.</p>
<p>"My name is Gilland," I said, dropping my voice and stepping nearer.
  "I have just come from Bronx Park, New York."</p>
<p>He bowed, waiting for something more from me; so I presented my
  credentials.</p>
<p>His formal manner changed at once. "Come over here and let us talk a
  bit," he said, cordially—then hesitated, glancing at Miss
  Barrison—"if your wife would excuse us—"</p>
<p>The pretty stenographer colored, and I dryly set Mr. Rowan
  right—which appeared to disturb him more than his mistake.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>"Pardon me, Mr. Gilland, but you do not propose to take this young
  girl into the Everglades, do you?"</p>
<p>"That's what I had proposed to do," I said, brusquely.</p>
<p>Perfectly aware that I resented his inquiry, he cast a perplexed and
  troubled glance at her, then slowly led the way to a great block of
  sun-warmed coquina, where he sat down, motioning me to do the same.</p>
<p>"I see," he said, "that you don't know just where you are going or
  just what you are expected to do."</p>
<p>"No, I don't," I said.</p>
<p>"Well, I'll tell you, then. You are going into the devil's own country
  to look for something that I fled five hundred miles to avoid."</p>
<p>"Is that so?" I said, uneasily.</p>
<p>"That is so, Mr. Gilland."</p>
<p>"Oh! And what is this object that I am to look for and from which you
  fled five hundred miles?"</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"You don't know what you ran away from?"</p>
<p>"No, sir. Perhaps if I had known I should have run a thousand miles."</p>
<p>We eyed one another.</p>
<p>"You think, then, that I'd better send Miss Barrison back to New
  York?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I certainly do. It may be murder to take her."</p>
<p>"Then I'll do it!" I said, nervously. "Back she goes from the first
  railroad station."</p>
<p>In a flash the thought came to me that here was a way to avoid the
  wrath of Professor Farrago—and a good excuse, too. He might forgive
  my not bringing a man as stenographer in view of my limited time; he
  never would forgive my presenting him with a woman.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>"She must go back," I repeated; and it rather surprised me to find
  myself already anticipating loneliness—something that never in all my
  travels had I experienced before.</p>
<p>"By the first train," I added, firmly, disliking Mr. Rowan without any
  reason except that he had suddenly deprived me of my stenographer.</p>
<p>"What I have to tell you," he began, lighting a cigarette, the mate to
  which I declined, "is this: Three years ago, before I entered this
  contracting business, I was in the government employ as officer in the
  Coast Survey. Our duties took us into Florida waters; we were months
  at a time working on shore."</p>
<p>He pulled thoughtfully at his cigarette and blew a light cloud into
  the air.</p>
<p>"I had leave for a month once; and like an ass I prepared to spend it
  in a hunting-trip among the Everglades."</p>
<p>He crossed his lean legs and gazed meditatively at his cigarette.</p>
<p>"I believe," he went on, "that we penetrated the Everglades farther
  than any white man who ever lived to return. There's nothing very
  dismal about the Everglades—the greater part, I mean. You get high
  and low hummock, marshes, creeks, lakes, and all that. If you get
  lost, you're a goner. If you acquire fever, you're as well off as the
  seraphim—and not a whit better. There are the usual animals
  there—bears (little black fellows) lynxes, deer, panthers,
  alligators, and a few stray crocodiles. As for snakes, of course
  they're there, moccasins a-plenty, some rattlers, but, after all, not
  as many snakes as one finds in Alabama, or even northern Florida and
  Georgia.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>"The Seminoles won't help you—won't even talk to you. They're a
  sullen pack—but not murderous, as far as I know. Beyond their inner
  limits lie the unknown regions."</p>
<p>He bit the wet end from his cigarette.</p>
<p>"I went there," he said; "I came out as soon as I could."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Well—for one thing, my companion died of fright."</p>
<p>"Fright? What at?"</p>
<p>"Well, there's something in there."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>He fixed a penetrating gaze on me. "I don't know, Mr. Gilland."</p>
<p>"Did you see anything to frighten you?" I insisted.</p>
<p>"No, but I felt something." He dropped his cigarette and ground it
  into the sand viciously. "To cut it short," he said, "I am most
  unwillingly led to believe that there are—creatures—of some sort in
  the Everglades—living creatures quite as large as you or I—and that
  they are perfectly transparent—as transparent as a colorless
  jellyfish."</p>
<p>Instantly the veiled import of Professor Farrago's letter was made
  clear to me. He, too, believed that.</p>
<p>"It embarrasses me like the devil to say such a thing," continued
  Rowan, digging in the sand with his spurred heels. "It seems so—so
  like a whopping lie—it seems so childish and ridiculous—so cursed
  cheap! But I fled; and there you are. I might add," he said,
  indifferently, "that I have the ordinary portion of courage allotted
  to normal men."</p>
<p>"But what do you believe these—these animals to be?" I asked,
  fascinated.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>"I don't know." An obstinate look came into his eyes. "I don't know,
  and I absolutely refuse to speculate for the benefit of anybody. I
  wouldn't do it for my friend Professor Farrago; and I'm not going to
  do it for you," he ended, laughing a rather grim laugh that somehow
  jarred me into realizing the amazing import of his story. For I did
  not doubt it, strange as it was—fantastic, incredible though it
  sounded in the ears of a scientist.</p>
<p>What it was that carried conviction I do not know—perhaps the fact
  that my superior credited it; perhaps the manner of narration. Told in
  quiet, commonplace phrases, by an exceedingly practical and
  unimaginative young man who was plainly embarrassed in the telling,
  the story rang out like a shout in a cañon, startling because of the
  absolute lack of emphasis employed in the telling.</p>
<p>"Professor Farrago asked me to speak of this to no one except the man
  who should come to his assistance. He desired the first chance of
  clearing this—this rather perplexing matter. No doubt he didn't want
  exploring parties prowling about him," added Rowan, smiling. "But
  there's no fear of that, I fancy. I never expect to tell that story
  again to anybody; I shouldn't have told him, only somehow it's worried
  me for three years, and though I was deadly afraid of ridicule, I
  finally made up my mind that science ought to have a hack at it.</p>
<p>"When I was in New York last winter I summoned up courage and wrote
  Professor Farrago. He came to see me at the Holland House that same
  evening; I told him as much as I ever shall tell anybody. That is all,
  Mr. Gilland."</p>
<p>For a long time I sat silent, musing over the strange <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>words. After a
  while I asked him whether Professor Farrago was supplied with
  provisions; and he said he was; that a great store of staples and tins
  of concentrated rations had been carried in as far as Little Sprite
  Lake; that Professor Farrago was now there alone, having insisted upon
  dismissing all those he had employed.</p>
<p>"There was no practical use for a guide," added Rowan, "because no
  cracker, no Indian, and no guide knows the region beyond the Seminole
  country."</p>
<p>I rose, thanking him and offering my hand. He took it and shook it in
  manly fashion, saying: "I consider Professor Farrago a very brave man;
  I may say the same of any man who volunteers to accompany him.
  Good-bye, Mr. Gilland; I most earnestly wish for your success.
  Professor Farrago left this letter for you."</p>
<p>And that was all. I climbed back into the rickety carriage, carrying
  my unopened letter; the negro driver cracked his whip and whistled,
  and the horses trotted inland over a fine shell road which was to lead
  us across Verbena Junction to Citron City. Half an hour later we
  crossed the tracks at Verbena and turned into a broad marl road. This
  aroused me from my deep and speculative reverie, and after a few
  moments I asked Miss Barrison's indulgence and read the letter from
  Professor Farrago which Mr. Rowan had given me:</p>
<div class="block2"><p>"<span class="sc">Dear Mr. Gilland</span>,—You now know all I dared not
  write, fearing to bring a swarm of explorers about my ears in
  case the letter was lost, and found by unscrupulous meddlers.
  If you still are willing to volunteer, knowing all that I
  know, join me as soon as possible. If family considerations
  deter you from taking what perhaps is an insane risk, I shall
  not expect you to join me. In that event, return to New York
  immediately and send Kingsley.</p>
  <p class="right">"Yours,
    F."</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>"What the deuce is the matter with him!" I exclaimed, irritably. "I'll
  take any chances Kingsley does!"</p>
<p>Miss Barrison looked up in surprise.</p>
<p>"Miss Barrison," I said, plunging into the subject headfirst, "I'm
  extremely sorry, but I have news that forces me to believe the journey
  too dangerous for you to attempt, so I think that it would be much
  better—" The consternation in her pretty face checked me.</p>
<p>"I'm awfully sorry," I muttered, appalled by her silence.</p>
<p>"But—but you engaged me!"</p>
<p>"I know it—I should not have done it. I only—"</p>
<p>"But you did engage me, didn't you?"</p>
<p>"I believe that I did—er—oh, of course—"</p>
<p>"But a verbal contract is binding between honorable people, isn't it,
  Mr. Gilland?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but—"</p>
<p>"And ours was a verbal contract; and in consideration you paid me my
  first week's salary, and I bought shirt-waists and a short skirt and
  three changes of—and tooth-brushes and—"</p>
<p>"I know, I know," I groaned. "But I'll fix all that."</p>
<p>"You can't if you break your contract."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because," she said, flushing up, "I should not accept."</p>
<p>"You don't understand—"</p>
<p>"Really I do. You are going into a dangerous country and you're afraid
  I'll be frightened."</p>
<p>"It's something like that."</p>
<p>"Tell me what are the dangers?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>"Alligators, big, bitey snakes—"</p>
<p>"Oh, you've said all that before!"</p>
<p>"Seminoles—"</p>
<p>"And that too. What else is there? Did the young man in the sun-helmet
  tell you of something worse?"</p>
<p>"Yes—much worse! Something so dreadfully horrible that—"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I am not at liberty to tell you, Miss Barrison," I said, striving to
  appear shocked.</p>
<p>"It would not make any difference anyway," she observed, calmly. "I'm
  not afraid of anything in the world."</p>
<p>"Yes, you are!" I said. "Listen to me; I'd be awfully glad to have you
  go—I—I really had no idea how I'd miss you—miss such pleasant
  companionship. But it is not possible—" The recollection of Professor
  Farrago's aversion suddenly returned. "No, no," I said, "it can't be
  done. I'm most unhappy over this mistake of mine; please don't look as
  though you were ready to cry!"</p>
<p>"Don't discharge me, Mr. Gilland," she said.</p>
<p>"I'm a brute to do it, but I must; I was a bigger brute to engage you,
  but I did. Don't—please don't look at me that way, Miss Barrison! As
  a matter of fact, I'm tender-hearted and I can't endure it."</p>
<p>"If you only knew what I had been through you wouldn't send me away,"
  she said, in a low voice. "It took my last penny to clothe myself and
  pay for the last lesson at the college of stenography. I—I lived on
  almost nothing for weeks; every respectable place was filled; I walked
  and walked and walked, and nobody <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>wanted me—they all required people
  with experience—and how can I have experience until I begin, Mr.
  Gilland? I was perfectly desperate when I went to see you, knowing
  that you had advertised for a man—" The slightest break in her clear
  voice scared me.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to cry," she said, striving to smile. "If I must go, I
  will go. I—I didn't mean to say all this—but—but I've been so—so
  discouraged;—and you were not very cross with me—"</p>
<p>Smitten with remorse, I picked up her hand and fell to patting it
  violently, trying to think of something to say. The exercise did not
  appear to stimulate my wits.</p>
<p>"Then—then I'm to go with you?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I will see," I said, weakly, "but I fear there's trouble ahead for
  this expedition."</p>
<p>"I fear there is," she agreed, in a cheerful voice. "You have a rifle
  and a cage in your luggage. Are you going to trap Indians and have me
  report their language?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm not going to trap Indians," I said, sharply. "They may trap
  us—but that's a detail. What I want to say to you is this: Professor
  Farrago detests unmarried women, and I forgot it when I engaged you."</p>
<p>"Oh, is that all?" she asked, laughing.</p>
<p>"Not all, but enough to cost me my position."</p>
<p>"How absurd! Why, there are millions of things we might
  do!—millions!"</p>
<p>"What's one of them?" I inquired.</p>
<p>"Why, we might pretend to be married!" Her frank and absolutely
  innocent delight in this suggestion was refreshing, but troubling.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>"We would have to be demonstrative to make that story go," I said.</p>
<p>"Why? Well-bred people are not demonstrative in public," she retorted,
  turning a trifle pink.</p>
<p>"No, but in private—"</p>
<p>"I think there is no necessity for carrying a pleasantry into our
  private life," she said, in a perfectly amiable voice. "Anyway, if
  Professor Farrago's feelings are to be spared, no sacrifice on the
  part of a mere girl could be too great," she added, gayly; "I will
  wear men's clothes if you wish."</p>
<p>"You may have to anyhow in the jungle," I said; "and as it's not an
  uncommon thing these days, nobody would ever take you for anything
  except what you are—a very wilful and plucky and persistent and—"</p>
<p>"And what, Mr. Gilland?"</p>
<p>"And attractive," I muttered.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mr. Gilland."</p>
<p>"You're welcome," I snapped. The near whistle of a locomotive warned
  us, and I rose in the carriage, looking out across the sand-hills.</p>
<p>"That is probably our train," observed the pretty stenographer.</p>
<p>"<i>Our</i> train!"</p>
<p>"Yes; isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Then you insist—"</p>
<p>"Ah, no, Mr. Gilland; I only trust implicitly in my employer."</p>
<p>"We'll wait till we get to Citron City," I said, weakly; "then it will
  be time enough to discuss the situation, won't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed," she said, smiling; but she knew, and I <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>already feared,
  that the situation no longer admitted of discussion. In a few moments
  more we emerged, without warning, from the scrub-crested sand-hills
  into the single white street of Citron City, where China-trees hung
  heavy with bloom, and magnolias, already set with perfumed candelabra,
  spread soft, checkered shadows over the marl.</p>
<p>The train lay at the station, oceans of heavy, black smoke lazily
  flowing from the locomotive; negroes were hoisting empty fruit-crates
  aboard the baggage-car, through the door of which I caught a glimpse
  of my steel cage and remaining paraphernalia, all securely crated.</p>
<p>"Telegram hyah foh Mistuh Gilland," remarked the operator, lounging at
  his window as we descended from our dusty vehicle. He had not
  addressed himself to anybody in particular, but I said that I was Mr.
  Gilland, and he produced the envelope. "Toted in from Okeechobee?" he
  inquired, listlessly.</p>
<p>"Probably; it's signed 'Farrago,' isn't it?"</p>
<p>"It's foh yoh, suh, I reckon," said the operator, handing it out with
  a yawn. Then he removed his hat and fanned his head, which was
  perfectly bald.</p>
<p>I opened the yellow envelope. "Get me a good dog with points," was the
  laconic message; and it irritated me to receive such idiotic
  instructions at such a time and in such a place. A good dog? Where the
  mischief could I find a dog in a town consisting of ten houses and a
  water-tank? I said as much to the bald-headed operator, who smiled
  wearily and replaced his hat: "Dawg? They's moh houn'-dawgs in Citron
  City than they's wood-ticks to keep them busy. I reckon a dollah 'll
  do a heap foh you, suh."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>"Could you get me a dog for a dollar?" I asked;—"one with points?"</p>
<p>"Points? I sholy can, suh;—plenty of points. What kind of dawg do yoh
  requiah, suh?—live dawg? daid dawg? houn'-dawg? raid-dawg? hawg-dawg?
  coon-dawg?—"</p>
<p>The locomotive emitted a long, lazy, softly modulated and thoroughly
  Southern toot. I handed the operator a silver dollar, and he presently
  emerged from his office and slouched off up the street, while I walked
  with Miss Barrison to the station platform, where I resumed the
  discussion of her future movements.</p>
<p>"You are very young to take such a risk," I said, gravely. "Had I not
  better buy your ticket back to New York? The north-bound train meets
  this one. I suppose we are waiting for it now—" I stopped, conscious
  of her impatience.</p>
<p>Her face flushed brightly: "Yes; I think it best. I have embarrassed
  you too long already—"</p>
<p>"Don't say that!" I muttered. "I—I—shall be deadly bored without
  you."</p>
<p>"I am not an entertainer, only a stenographer," she said, curtly.
  "Please get me my ticket, Mr. Gilland."</p>
<p>She gazed at me from the car-platform; the locomotive tooted two
  drawling toots.</p>
<p>"It is for your sake," I said, avoiding her gaze as the far-off
  whistle of the north-bound express came floating out of the blue
  distance.</p>
<p>She did not answer; I fished out my watch, regarding it in silence,
  listening to the hum of the approaching train, which ought presently
  to bear her away into the North, where nothing could menace her except
  the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>brilliant pitfalls of a Christian civilization. But I stood
  there, temporizing, unable to utter a word as her train shot by us
  with a rush, slower, slower, and finally stopped, with a long-drawn
  sigh from the air-brakes.</p>
<p>At that instant the telegraph-operator appeared, carrying a dog by the
  scruff of the neck—a sad-eyed, ewe-necked dog, from the four corners
  of which dangled enormous, cushion-like paws. He yelped when he beheld
  me. Miss Barrison leaned down from the car-platform and took the
  animal into her arms, uttering a suppressed exclamation of pity as she
  lifted him.</p>
<p>"You have your hands full," she said to me; "I'll take him into the
  car for you."</p>
<p>She mounted the steps; I followed with the valises, striving to get a
  good view of my acquisition over her shoulder.</p>
<p>"That isn't the kind of dog I wanted!" I repeated again and again,
  inspecting the animal as it sprawled on the floor of the car at the
  edge of Miss Barrison's skirt. "That dog is all voice and feet and
  emotion! What makes it stick up its paws like that? I don't want that
  dog and I'm not going to identify myself with it! Where's the
  operator—"</p>
<p>I turned towards the car-window; the operator's bald head was visible
  on a line with the sill, and I made motions at him. He bowed with
  courtly grace, as though I were thanking him.</p>
<p>"I'm not!" I cried, shaking my head. "I wanted a dog with points—not
  the kind of points that stick up all over this dog. Take him away!"</p>
<p>The operator's head appeared to be gliding out of my range of vision;
  then the windows of the north-bound <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>train slid past, faster and
  faster. A melancholy grace-note from the dog, a jolt, and I turned
  around, appalled.</p>
<p>"This train is going," I stammered, "and you are on it!"</p>
<p>Miss Barrison sprang up and started towards the door, and I sped after
  her.</p>
<p>"I can jump," she said, breathlessly, edging out to the platform;
  "please let me! There is time yet—if you only wouldn't hold me—so
  tight—"</p>
<p>A few moments later we walked slowly back together through the car and
  took seats facing one another.</p>
<p>Between us sat the hound-dog, a prey to melancholy unutterable.</p>

</p><h3>XV<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc" class="pginternal">ToC</a></span></h3>
<p><br>
</p><p>It was on Sunday when I awoke to the realization that I had quitted
  civilization and was afloat on an unfamiliar body of water in an open
  boat containing—</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">One light steel cage,<br></span>
  <span class="i0">One rifle and ammunition,<br></span>
  <span class="i0">One stenographer,<br></span>
  <span class="i0">Three ounces rosium oxide,<br></span>
  <span class="i0">One hound-dog,<br></span>
  <span class="i0">Two valises.<br></span>
</div></div>
<p>A playful wave slopped over the bow and I lost count; but the pretty
  stenographer made the inventory, while I resumed the oars, and the dog
  punctured the primeval silence with staccato yelps.</p>
<p>A few minutes later everything and everybody was accounted for; the
  sky was blue and the palms waved, and several species of dicky-birds
  tuned up as I pulled with powerful strokes out into the sunny waters
  of Little Sprite Lake, now within a few miles of my journey's end.</p>
<p>From ponds hidden in the marshes herons rose in lazily laborious
  flight, flapping low across the water; high in the cypress yellow-eyed
  ospreys bent crested heads to watch our progress; sun-baked
  alligators, lying <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>heavily in the shoreward sedge, slid open, glassy
  eyes as we passed.</p>
<p>"Even the 'gators make eyes at you," I said, resting on my oars.</p>
<p>We were on terms of badinage.</p>
<p>"Who was it who shed crocodile tears at the prospect of shipping me
  North?" she inquired.</p>
<p>"Speaking of tears," I observed, "somebody is likely to shed a number
  when Professor Farrago is picked up."</p>
<p>"Pooh!" she said, and snapped her pretty, sun-tanned fingers; and I
  resumed the oars in time to avoid shipwreck on a large mud-bar.</p>
<p>She reclined in the stern, serenely occupied with the view, now and
  then caressing the discouraged dog, now and then patting her hair
  where the wind had loosened a bright strand.</p>
<p>"If Professor Farrago didn't expect a woman stenographer," she said,
  abruptly, "why did he instruct you to bring a complete outfit of
  woman's clothing?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," I said, tartly.</p>
<p>"But you bought them. Are they for a young woman or an old woman?"</p>
<p>"I don't know; I sent a messenger to a department store. I don't know
  what he bought."</p>
<p>"Didn't you look them over?"</p>
<p>"No. Why? I should have been no wiser. I fancy they're all right,
  because the bill was eighteen hundred dollars—"</p>
<p>The pretty stenographer sat up abruptly.</p>
<p>"Is that much?" I asked, uneasily. "I've always heard women's clothing
  was expensive. Wasn't it enough? I told the boy to order the
  best;—Professor <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>Farrago always requires the very best scientific
  instruments, and—I listed the clothes as scientific accessories—that
  being the object of this expedition—<i>What</i> are you laughing at?"</p>
<p>When it pleased her to recover her gravity she announced her desire to
  inspect and repack the clothing; but I refused.</p>
<p>"They're for Professor Farrago," I said. "I don't know what he wants
  of them. I don't suppose he intends to wear 'em and caper about the
  jungle, but they're his. I got them because he told me to. I bought a
  cage, too, to fit myself, but I don't suppose he means to put me in
  it. Perhaps," I added, "he may invite you into it."</p>
<p>"Let me refold the gowns," she pleaded, persuasively. "What does a
  clumsy man know about packing such clothing as that? If you don't,
  they'll be ruined. It's a shame to drag those boxes about through mud
  and water!"</p>
<p>So we made a landing, and lifted out and unlocked the boxes. All I
  could see inside were mounds of lace and ribbons, and with a vague
  idea that Miss Barrison needed no assistance I returned to the boat
  and sat down to smoke until she was ready.</p>
<p>When she summoned me her face was flushed and her eyes bright.</p>
<p>"Those are certainly the most beautiful things!" she said, softly.
  "Why, it is like a bride's trousseau—absolutely complete—all except
  the bridal gown—"</p>
<p>"Isn't there a dress there?" I exclaimed, in alarm.</p>
<p>"No—not a day-dress."</p>
<p>"Night-dresses!" I shrieked. "He doesn't want <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>women's night-dresses!
  He's a bachelor! Good Heavens! I've done it this time!"</p>
<p>"But—but who is to wear them?" she asked.</p>
<p>"How do I know? I don't know anything; I can only presume that he
  doesn't intend to open a department store in the Everglades. And if
  any lady is to wear garments in his vicinity, I assume that those
  garments are to be anything except diaphanous!... Please take your
  seat in the boat, Miss Barrison. I want to row and think."</p>
<p>I had had my fill of exercise and thought when, about four o'clock in
  the afternoon, Miss Barrison directed my attention to a point of palms
  jutting out into the water about a mile to the southward.</p>
<p>"That's Farrago!" I exclaimed, catching sight of a United States flag
  floating majestically from a bamboo-pole. "Give me the megaphone, if
  you please."</p>
<p>She handed me the instrument; I hailed the shore; and presently a man
  appeared under the palms at the water's edge.</p>
<p>"Hello!" I roared, trying to inject cheerfulness into the hollow
  bellow. "How are you, professor?"</p>
<p>The answer came distinctly across the water:</p>
<p>"<i>Who</i> is that with you?"</p>
<p>My lips were buried in the megaphone; I strove to speak; I only
  produced a ghastly, chuckling sound.</p>
<p>"Of course you expect to tell the truth," observed the pretty
  stenographer, quietly.</p>
<p>I removed my lips from the megaphone and looked around at her. She
  returned my gaze with a disturbing smile.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>"I want to mitigate the blow," I said, hoarsely. "Tell me how."</p>
<p>"I'm sure I don't know," she said, sweetly.</p>
<p>"Well, <i>I</i> do!" I fairly barked, and seizing the megaphone again, I
  set it to my lips and roared, "My fiancée!"</p>
<p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed Miss Barrison, in consternation, "I thought
  you were going to tell the truth!"</p>
<p>"Don't do that or you'll upset us," I snapped—"I'm telling the truth;
  I've engaged myself to you; I did it mentally before I bellowed."</p>
<p>"But—"</p>
<p>"You know as well as I do what engagements mean," I said, picking up
  the oars and digging them deep in the blue water.</p>
<p>She assented uncertainly.</p>
<p>A few minutes more of vigorous rowing brought us to a muddy landing
  under a cluster of tall palmettos, where a gasoline launch lay.
  Professor Farrago came down to the shore as I landed, and I walked
  ahead to meet him. He was the maddest man I ever saw. But I was his
  match, for I was desperate.</p>
<p>"What the devil—" he began, under his breath.</p>
<p>"Nonsense!" I said, deliberately. "An engaged woman is practically
  married already, because marriages are made in heaven."</p>
<p>"Good Lord!" he gasped, "are you mad, Gilland? I sent for a
  stenographer—"</p>
<p>"Miss Barrison is a stenographer," I said, calmly; and before he could
  recover I had presented him, and left them face to face, washing my
  hands of the whole affair.</p>
<p>Unloading the boat and carrying the luggage up under the palms, I
  heard her saying:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>"No, I am not in the least afraid of snakes, and I am quite ready to
  begin my duties."</p>
<p>And he: "Mr. Gilland is a young man who—er—lacks practical
  experience."</p>
<p>And she: "Mr. Gilland has been most thoughtful for my comfort. The
  journey has been perfectly heavenly."</p>
<p>And he, clumsily: "Ahem!—the—er—celestial aspect of your journey
  has—er—doubtless been colored by—er—the prospect of
  your—er—approaching nuptials—"</p>
<p>She, hastily: "Oh, I do not think so, professor."</p>
<p>"Idiot!" I muttered, dragging the dog to the shore, where his yelps
  brought the professor hurrying.</p>
<p>"Is <i>that</i> the dog?" he inquired, adjusting his spectacles.</p>
<p>"That's the dog," I said. "He's full of points, you see?"</p>
<p>"Oh," mused the professor; "I thought he was full of—" He hesitated,
  inspecting the animal, who, nose to the ground, stood investigating a
  smell of some sort.</p>
<p>"See," I said, with enthusiasm, "he's found a scent; he's trailing it
  already! Now he's rolling on it!"</p>
<p>"He's rolling on one of our concentrated food lozenges," said the
  professor, dryly. "Tie him up, Mr. Gilland, and ask Mrs. Gilland to
  come up to camp. Your room is ready."</p>
<p>"Rooms," I corrected; "she isn't Mrs. Gilland yet," I added, with a
  forced smile.</p>
<p>"But you're practically married," observed the professor, "as you
  pointed out to me. And if she's practically Mrs. Gilland, why not say
  so?"</p>
<p>"Don't, all the same," I snarled.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>"But marriages are made in—"</p>
<p>I cast a desperate eye upon him.</p>
<p>From that moment, whenever we were alone together, he made a target of
  me. I never had supposed him humorously vindictive; he was, and his
  apparently innocent mistakes almost turned my hair gray.</p>
<p>But to Miss Barrison he was kind and courteous, and for a time
  over-serious. Observing him, I could never detect the slightest
  symptom of dislike for her sex—a failing which common rumor had
  always credited him with to the verge of absolute rudeness.</p>
<p>On the contrary, it was perfectly plain to anybody that he liked her.
  There was in his manner towards her a mixture of business formality
  and the deferential attitude of a gentleman.</p>
<p>We were seated, just before sunset, outside of the hut built of
  palmetto logs, when Professor Farrago, addressing us both, began the
  explanation of our future duties.</p>
<p>Miss Barrison, it appeared, was to note everything said by himself,
  making several shorthand copies by evening. In other words, she was to
  report every scrap of conversation she heard while in the Everglades.
  And she nodded intelligently as he finished, and drew pad and pencil
  from the pocket of her walking-skirt, jotting down his instructions as
  a beginning. I could see that he was pleased.</p>
<p>"The reason I do this," he said, "is because I do not wish to hide
  anything that transpires while we are on this expedition. Only the
  most scrupulously minute record can satisfy me; no details are too
  small to merit record; I demand and I court from my fellow-scientists
  and from the public the fullest investigation."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>He smiled slightly, turning towards me.</p>
<p>"You know, Mr. Gilland, how dangerous to the reputation of a
  scientific man is any line of investigation into the unusual. If a man
  once is even suspected of charlatanism, of sensationalism, of turning
  his attention to any phenomena not strictly within the proper pale of
  scientific investigation, that man is doomed to ridicule; his
  profession disowns him; he becomes a man without honor, without
  authority. Is it not so?"</p>
<p>"Yes," I said.</p>
<p>"Therefore," he resumed, thoughtfully, "as I do most firmly believe in
  the course I am now pursuing, whether I succeed or fail I desire a
  true and minute record made, hiding nothing of what may be said or
  done. A stenographer alone can give this to the world, while I can
  only supplement it with a description of events—if I live to
  transcribe them."</p>
<p>Sunk in profound reverie he sat there silent under the great, smooth
  palm-tree—a venerable figure in his yellow dressing-gown and carpet
  slippers. Seated side by side, we waited, a trifle awed. I could hear
  the soft breathing of the pretty stenographer beside me.</p>
<p>"First of all," said Professor Farrago, looking up, "I must be able to
  trust those who are here to aid me."</p>
<p>"I—I will be faithful," said the girl, in a low voice.</p>
<p>"I do not doubt you, my child," he said; "nor you, Gilland. And so I
  am going to tell you this much now—more, I hope, later."</p>
<p>And he sat up straight, lifting an impressive forefinger.</p>
<p>"Mr. Rowan, lately an officer of our Coast Survey, wrote me a letter
  from the Holland House in New <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>York—a letter so strange that, on
  reading it, I immediately repaired to his hotel, where for hours we
  talked together.</p>
<p>"The result of that conference is this expedition.</p>
<p>"I have now been here two months, and I am satisfied of certain facts.
  First, there do exist in this unexplored wilderness certain forms of
  life which are solid and palpable, but transparent and practically
  invisible. Second, these living creatures belong to the animal
  kingdom, are warm-blooded vertebrates, possess powers of locomotion,
  but whether that of flight I am not certain. Third, they appear to
  possess such senses as we enjoy—smell, touch, sight, hearing, and no
  doubt the sense of taste. Fourth, their skin is smooth to the touch,
  and the temperature of the epidermis appears to approximate that of a
  normal human being. Fifth and last, whether bipeds or quadrupeds I do
  not know, though all evidence appears to confirm my theory that they
  walk erect. One pair of their limbs appear to terminate in a sort of
  foot—like a delicately shaped human foot, except that there appear to
  be no toes. The other pair of limbs terminate in something that, from
  the single instance I experienced, seemed to resemble soft but firm
  antennæ or, perhaps, digitated palpi—"</p>
<p>"Feelers!" I blurted out.</p>
<p>"I don't know, but I think so. Once, when I was standing in the
  forest, perfectly aware that creatures I could not see had stealthily
  surrounded me, the tension was brought to a crisis when over my face,
  from cheek to chin, stole a soft something, brushing the skin as
  delicately as a child's fingers might brush it."</p>
<p>"Good Lord!" I breathed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>A care-worn smile crept into his eyes. "A test for nerves, you think,
  Mr. Gilland? I agree with you. Nobody fears what anybody can see."</p>
<p>There came the slightest movement beside me.</p>
<p>"Are you trembling?" I asked, turning.</p>
<p>"I was writing," she replied, steadily. "Did my elbow touch you?"</p>
<p>"By-the-way," said Professor Farrago, "I fear I forgot to congratulate
  you upon your choice of a stenographer, Mr. Gilland."</p>
<p>A rosy light stole over her pale face.</p>
<p>"Am I to record that too?" she asked, raising her blue eyes.</p>
<p>"Certainly," he replied, gravely.</p>
<p>"But, professor," I began, a prey to increasing excitement, "do you
  propose to attempt the capture of one of these animals?"</p>
<p>"That is what the cage is for," he said. "I supposed you had guessed
  that."</p>
<p>"I had," murmured the pretty stenographer.</p>
<p>"I do not doubt it," said Professor Farrago, gravely.</p>
<p>"What are the chemicals for—and the tank and hose attachment?"</p>
<p>"Think, Mr. Gilland."</p>
<p>"I can't; I'm almost stunned by what you tell me."</p>
<p>He laughed. "The rosium oxide and salts of strontium are to be dumped
  into the tank together. They'll effervesce, of course."</p>
<p>"Of course," I muttered.</p>
<p>"And I can throw a rose-colored spray over any object by the hose
  attachment, can't I?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>"Well, I tried it on a transparent jelly-fish and it became perfectly
  visible and of a beautiful rose-color: and I tried it on rock-crystal,
  and on glass, and on pure gelatine, and all became suffused with a
  delicate pink glow, which lasted for hours or minutes according to the
  substance.... Now you understand, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes; you want to see what sort of creature you have to deal with."</p>
<p>"Exactly; so when I've trapped it I am going to spray it." He turned
  half humorously towards the stenographer: "I fancy you understood long
  before Mr. Gilland did."</p>
<p>"I don't think so," she said, with a sidelong lifting of the heavy
  lashes; and I caught the color of her eyes for a second.</p>
<p>"You see how Miss Barrison spares your feelings," observed Professor
  Farrago, dryly. "She owes you little gratitude for bringing her here,
  yet she proves a generous victim."</p>
<p>"Oh, I am very grateful for this rarest of chances!" she said, shyly.
  "To be among the first in the world to discover such wonders ought to
  make me very grateful to the man who gave me the opportunity."</p>
<p>"Do you mean Mr. Gilland?" asked the professor, laughing.</p>
<p>I had never before seen Professor Farrago laugh such a care-free
  laugh; I had never suspected him of harboring even an embryo of the
  social graces. Dry as dust, sapless as steel, precise as the magnetic
  needle, he had hitherto been to me the mummified embodiment of science
  militant. Now, in the guise of a perfectly human and genial old
  gentleman, I scarcely recognized my <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>superior of the Bronx Park
  society. And as a woman-hater he was a miserable failure.</p>
<p>"Heavens," I thought to myself, "am I becoming jealous of my revered
  professor's social success with a stray stenographer?" I felt mean,
  and I probably looked it, and I was glad that telepathy did not permit
  Miss Barrison to record my secret and unworthy ruminations.</p>
<p>The professor was saying: "These transparent creatures break off
  berries and fruits and branches; I have seen a flower, too, plucked
  from its stem by invisible digits and borne swiftly through the
  forest—only the flower visible, apparently speeding through the air
  and out of sight among the thickets.</p>
<p>"I have found the footprints that I described to you, usually on the
  edge of a stream or in the soft loam along some forest lake or lost
  lagoon.</p>
<p>"Again and again I have been conscious in the forest that unseen eyes
  were fixed on me, that unseen shapes were following me. Never but that
  one time did these invisible creatures close in around me and venture
  to touch me.</p>
<p>"They may be weak; their structure may be frail, and they may be
  incapable of violence or harm, but the depth of the footprints
  indicates a weight of at least one hundred and thirty pounds, and it
  certainly requires some muscular strength to break off a branch of
  wild guavas."</p>
<p>He bent his noble head, thoughtfully regarding the design on his
  slippers.</p>
<p>"What was the rifle for?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Defence, not aggression," he said, simply.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>"And the camera?"</p>
<p>"A camera record is necessary in these days of bad artists."</p>
<p>I hesitated, glancing at Miss Barrison. She was still writing, her
  pretty head bent over the pad in her lap.</p>
<p>"And the clothing?" I asked, carelessly.</p>
<p>"Did you get it?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"Of course—" I glanced at Miss Barrison. "There's no use writing down
  everything, is there?"</p>
<p>"Everything must be recorded," said Professor Farrago, inflexibly.
  "What clothing did you buy?"</p>
<p>"I forgot the gown," I said, getting red about the ears.</p>
<p>"Forgot the gown!" he repeated.</p>
<p>"Yes—one kind of gown—the day kind. I—I got the other kind."</p>
<p>He was annoyed; so was I. After a moment he got up, and crossing to
  the log cabin, opened one of the boxes of apparel.</p>
<p>"Is it what you wanted?" I inquired.</p>
<p>"Y-es, I presume so," he replied, visibly perplexed.</p>
<p>"It's the best to be had," said I.</p>
<p>"That's quite right," he said, musingly. "We use only the best of
  everything at Bronx Park. It is traditional with us, you know."</p>
<p>Curiosity pushed me. "Well, what on earth is it for?" I broke out.</p>
<p>He looked at me gravely over the tops of his spectacles—a striking
  and inspiring figure in his yellow flannel dressing-gown and
  slippers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>"I shall tell you some day—perhaps," he said, mildly. "Good-night,
  Miss Barrison; good-night, Mr. Gilland. You will find extra blankets
  on your bunk—"</p>
<p>"What!" I cried.</p>
<p>"Bunks," he said, and shut the door.</p>

</p><h3>XVI<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc" class="pginternal">ToC</a></span></h3>
<p><br>
</p><p>"There is something weird about this whole proceeding," I observed to
  the pretty stenographer next morning.</p>
<p>"These pies will be weird if you don't stop talking to me," she said,
  opening the doors of Professor Farrago's portable camping-oven and
  peeping in at the fragrant pastry.</p>
<p>The professor had gone off somewhere into the woods early that
  morning. As he was not in the habit of talking to himself, the
  services of Miss Barrison were not required. Before he started,
  however, he came to her with a request for a dozen pies, the
  construction of which he asked if she understood. She had been to
  cooking-school in more prosperous days, and she mentioned it; so at
  his earnest solicitation she undertook to bake for him twelve
  apple-pies; and she was now attempting it, assisted by advice from me.</p>
<p>"Are they burned?" I asked, sniffing the air.</p>
<p>"No, they are not burned, Mr. Gilland, but my finger is," she
  retorted, stepping back to examine the damage.</p>
<p>I offered sympathy and witch-hazel, but she would have none of my
  offerings, and presently returned to her pies.</p>
<p>"We can't eat all that pastry," I protested.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>"Professor Farrago said they were not for us to eat," she said,
  dusting each pie with powdered sugar.</p>
<p>"Well, what are they for? The dog? Or are they simply objets d'art to
  adorn the shanty—"</p>
<p>"You annoy me," she said.</p>
<p>"The pies annoy me; won't you tell me what they're for?"</p>
<p>"I have a pretty fair idea what they're for," she observed, tossing
  her head. "Haven't you?"</p>
<p>"No. What?"</p>
<p>"These pies are for bait."</p>
<p>"To bait hooks with?" I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Hooks! No, you silly man. They're for baiting the cage. He means to
  trap these transparent creatures in a cage baited with pie."</p>
<p>She laughed scornfully; inserted the burned tip of her finger in her
  mouth and stood looking at me defiantly like a flushed and bright-eyed
  school-girl.</p>
<p>"You think you're teasing me," she said; "but you do not realize what
  a singularly slow-minded young man you are."</p>
<p>I stopped laughing. "How did you come to the conclusion that pies were
  to be used for such a purpose?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I deduce," she observed, with an airy wave of her disengaged hand.</p>
<p>"Your deductions are weird—like everything else in this vicinity.
  Pies to catch invisible monsters? Pooh!"</p>
<p>"You're not particularly complimentary, are you?" she said.</p>
<p>"Not particularly; but I could be, with you for my inspiration. I
  could even be enthusiastic—"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>"About my pies?"</p>
<p>"No—about your eyes."</p>
<p>"You are very frivolous—for a scientist," she said, scornfully;
  "please subdue your enthusiasm and bring me some wood. This fire is
  almost out."</p>
<p>When I had brought the wood, she presented me with a pail of hot water
  and pointed at the dishes on the breakfast-table.</p>
<p>"Never!" I cried, revolted.</p>
<p>"Then I suppose I must do them—"</p>
<p>She looked pensively at her scorched finger-tip, and, pursing up her
  red lips, blew a gentle breath to cool it.</p>
<p>"I'll do the dishes," I said.</p>
<p>Splashing and slushing the cups and saucers about in the hot water, I
  reflected upon the events of the last few days. The dog, stupefied by
  unwonted abundance of food, lay in the sunshine, sleeping the sleep of
  repletion; the pretty stenographer, all rosy from her culinary
  exertions, was removing the pies and setting them in neat rows to
  cool.</p>
<p>"There," she said, with a sigh; "now I will dry the dishes for you....
  You didn't mention the fact, when you engaged me, that I was also
  expected to do general housework."</p>
<p>"I didn't engage you," I said, maliciously; "you engaged me, you
  know."</p>
<p>She regarded me disdainfully, nose uptilted.</p>
<p>"How thoroughly disagreeable you can be!" she said. "Dry your own
  dishes. I'm going for a stroll."</p>
<p>"May I join—"</p>
<p>"You may <i>not</i>! I shall go so far that you cannot possibly discover
  me."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>I watched her forestward progress; she sauntered for about thirty
  yards along the lake and presently sat down in plain sight under a
  huge live-oak.</p>
<p>A few moments later I had completed my task as general bottle-washer,
  and I cast about for something to occupy me.</p>
<p>First I approached and politely caressed the satiated dog. He woke up,
  regarded me with dully meditative eyes, yawned, and went to sleep
  again. Never a flop of tail to indicate gratitude for blandishments,
  never the faintest symptom of canine appreciation.</p>
<p>Chilled by my reception, I moused about for a while, poking into boxes
  and bundles; then raised my head and inspected the landscape. Through
  the vista of trees the pink shirt-waist of the pretty stenographer
  glimmered like a rose blooming in the wilderness.</p>
<p>From whatever point I viewed the prospect that pink spot seemed to
  intrude; I turned my back and examined the jungle, but there it was
  repeated in a hundred pink blossoms among the massed thickets; I
  looked up into the tree-tops, where pink mosses spotted the palms; I
  looked out over the lake, and I saw it in my mind's eye pinker than
  ever. It was certainly a case of pink-eye.</p>
<p>"I'll go for a stroll, too; it's a free country," I muttered.</p>
<p>After I had strolled in a complete circle I found myself within three
  feet of a pink shirt-waist.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon," I said; "I had no inten—"</p>
<p>"I thought you were never coming," she said, amiably.</p>
<p>"How is your finger?" I asked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>She held it up. I took it gingerly; it was smooth and faintly rosy at
  the tip.</p>
<p>"Does it hurt?" I inquired.</p>
<p>"Dreadfully. Your hands feel so cool—"</p>
<p>After a silence she said, "Thank you, that has cooled the burning."</p>
<p>"I am determined," said I, "to expel the fire from your finger if it
  takes hours and hours." And I seated myself with that intention.</p>
<p>For a while she talked, making innocent observations concerning the
  tropical foliage surrounding us. Then silence crept in between us,
  accentuated by the brooding stillness of the forest.</p>
<p>"I am afraid your hands are growing tired," she said, considerately.</p>
<p>I denied it.</p>
<p>Through the vista of palms we could see the lake, blue as a violet,
  sparkling with silvery sunshine. In the intense quiet the splash of
  leaping mullet sounded distinctly.</p>
<p>Once a tall crane stalked into view among the sedges; once an unseen
  alligator shook the silence with his deep, hollow roaring. Then the
  stillness of the wilderness grew more intense.</p>
<p>We had been sitting there for a long while without exchanging a word,
  dreamily watching the ripple of the azure water, when all at once
  there came a scurrying patter of feet through the forest, and, looking
  up, I beheld the hound-dog, tail between his legs, bearing down on us
  at lightning speed. I rose instantly.</p>
<p>"What is the matter with the dog?" cried the pretty stenographer. "Is
  he going mad, Mr. Gilland?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>"Something has scared him," I exclaimed, as the dog, eyes like lighted
  candles, rushed frantically between my legs and buried his head in
  Miss Barrison's lap.</p>
<p>"Poor doggy!" she said, smoothing the collapsed pup; "poor, p-oor
  little beast! Did anything scare him? Tell aunty all about it."</p>
<p>When a dog flees <i>without yelping</i> he's a badly frightened creature. I
  instinctively started back towards the camp whence the beast had fled,
  and before I had taken a dozen steps Miss Barrison was beside me,
  carrying the dog in her arms.</p>
<p>"I've an idea," she said, under her breath.</p>
<p>"What?" I asked, keeping my eyes on the camp.</p>
<p>"It's this: I'll wager that we find those pies gone!"</p>
<p>"Pies gone?" I repeated, perplexed; "what makes you think—"</p>
<p>"They <i>are</i> gone!" she exclaimed. "Look!"</p>
<p>I gaped stupidly at the rough pine table where the pies had stood in
  three neat rows of four each. And then, in a moment, the purport of
  this robbery flashed upon my senses.</p>
<p>"The transparent creatures!" I gasped.</p>
<p>"Hush!" she whispered, clinging to the trembling dog in her arms.</p>
<p>I listened. I could hear nothing, see nothing, yet slowly I became
  convinced of the presence of something unseen—something in the forest
  close by, watching us out of invisible eyes.</p>
<p>A chill, settling along my spine, crept upward to my scalp, until
  every separate hair wiggled to the roots. Miss Barrison was pale, but
  perfectly calm and self-possessed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>"Let us go in-doors," I said, as steadily as I could.</p>
<p>"Very well," she replied.</p>
<p>I held the door open; she entered with the dog; I followed, closing
  and barring the door, and then took my station at the window, rifle in
  hand.</p>
<p>There was not a sound in the forest. Miss Barrison laid the dog on the
  floor and quietly picked up her pad and pencil. Presently she was deep
  in a report of the phenomena, her pencil flying, leaf after leaf from
  the pad fluttering to the floor.</p>
<p>Nor did I at the window change my position of scared alertness, until
  I was aware of her hand gently touching my elbow to attract my
  attention, and her soft voice at my ear—</p>
<p>"You don't suppose by any chance that the dog ate those pies?"</p>
<p>I collected my tumultuous thoughts and turned to stare at the dog.</p>
<p>"Twelve pies, twelve inches each in diameter," she reflected,
  musingly. "One dog, twenty inches in diameter. How many times will the
  pies go into the dog? Let me see." She made a few figures on her pad,
  thought awhile, produced a tape-measure from her pocket, and, kneeling
  down, measured the dog.</p>
<p>"No," she said, looking up at me, "he couldn't contain them."</p>
<p>Inspired by her coolness and perfect composure, I set the rifle in the
  corner and opened the door. Sunlight fell in bars through the quiet
  woods; nothing stirred on land or water save the great, yellow-striped
  butterflies that fluttered and soared and floated above the flowering
  thickets bordering the jungle.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>The heat became intense; Miss Barrison went to her room to change her
  gown for a lighter one; I sat down under a live-oak, eyes and ears
  strained for any sign of our invisible neighbors.</p>
<p>When she emerged in the lightest and filmiest of summer gowns, she
  brought the camera with her; and for a while we took pictures of each
  other, until we had used up all but one film.</p>
<p>Desiring to possess a picture of Miss Barrison and myself seated
  together, I tied a string to the shutter-lever and attached the other
  end of the string to the dog, who had resumed his interrupted
  slumbers. At my whistle he jumped up nervously, snapping the lever,
  and the picture was taken.</p>
<p>With such innocent and harmless pastime we whiled away the afternoon.
  She made twelve more apple-pies. I mounted guard over them. And we
  were just beginning to feel a trifle uneasy about Professor Farrago,
  when he appeared, tramping sturdily through the forest, green umbrella
  and butterfly-net under one arm, shot-gun and cyanide-jar under the
  other, and his breast all criss-crossed with straps, from which
  dangled field-glasses, collecting-boxes, and botanizing-tins—an
  inspiring figure indeed—the embodied symbol of science indomitable,
  triumphant!</p>
<p>We hailed him with three guilty cheers; the dog woke up with a
  perfunctory bark—the first sound I had heard from him since he yelped
  his disapproval of me on the lagoon.</p>
<p>Miss Barrison produced three bowls full of boiling water and dropped
  three pellets of concentrated soup-meat into them, while I prepared
  coffee. And in a few <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>moments our simple dinner was ready—the red
  ants had been dusted from the biscuits, the spiders chased off the
  baked beans, the scorpions shaken from the napkins, and we sat down at
  the rough, improvised table under the palms.</p>
<p>The professor gave us a brief but modest account of his short tour of
  exploration. He had brought back a new species of orchid, several
  undescribed beetles, and a pocketful of coontie seed. He appeared,
  however, to be tired and singularly depressed, and presently we
  learned why.</p>
<p>It seemed that he had gone straight to that section of the forest
  where he had hitherto always found signs of the transparent and
  invisible creatures which he had determined to capture, and he had not
  found a single trace of them.</p>
<p>"It alarms me," he said, gravely. "If they have deserted this region,
  it might take a lifetime to locate them again in this wilderness."</p>
<p>Then, very quietly, sinking her voice instinctively, as though the
  unseen might be at our very elbows listening, Miss Barrison recounted
  the curious adventure which had befallen the dog and the first batch
  of apple-pies.</p>
<p>With visible and increasing excitement the professor listened until
  the very end. Then he struck the table with clinched fist—a
  resounding blow which set the concentrated soup dancing in the bowls
  and scattered the biscuits and the industrious red ants in every
  direction.</p>
<p>"Eureka!" he whispered. "Miss Barrison, your deduction was not only
  perfectly reasonable, but brilliant. You are right; the pies are for
  that very purpose. I conceived the idea when I first came here. Again
  and <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>again the pies that my guide made out of dried apples disappeared
  in a most astonishing and mysterious manner when left to cool. At
  length I determined to watch them every second; and did so, with the
  result that late one afternoon I was amazed to see a pie slowly rise
  from the table and move swiftly away through the air about four feet
  above the ground, finally disappearing into a tangle of jasmine and
  grape-vine.</p>
<p>"The apparently automatic flight of that pie solved the problem; these
  transparent creatures cannot resist that delicacy. Therefore I decided
  to bait the cage for them this very night—Look! What's the matter
  with that dog?"</p>
<p>The dog suddenly bounded into the air, alighted on all fours, ears,
  eyes, and muzzle concentrated on a point directly behind us.</p>
<p>"Good gracious! The pies!" faltered Miss Barrison, half rising from
  her seat; but the dog rushed madly into her skirts, scrambling for
  protection, and she fell back almost into my arms.</p>
<p>Clasping her tightly, I looked over my shoulder; the last pie was
  snatched from the table before my eyes and I saw it borne swiftly away
  by something unseen, straight into the deepening shadows of the
  forest.</p>
<p>The professor was singularly calm, even slightly ironical, as he
  turned to me, saying:</p>
<p>"Perhaps if you relinquish Miss Barrison she may be able to free
  herself from that dog."</p>
<p>I did so immediately, and she deposited the cowering dog in my arms.
  Her face had suddenly become pink.</p>
<p>I passed the dog on to Professor Farrago, dumping it viciously into
  his lap—a proceeding which struck me as <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>resembling a pastime of
  extreme youth known as "button, button, who's got the button?"</p>
<p>The professor examined the animal gravely, feeling its pulse, counting
  its respirations, and finally inserting a tentative finger in an
  attempt to examine its tongue. The dog bit him.</p>
<p>"Ouch! It's a clear case of fright," he said, gravely. "I wanted a dog
  to aid me in trailing these remarkable creatures, but I think this dog
  of yours is useless, Gilland."</p>
<p>"It's given us warning of the creatures' presence twice already," I
  argued.</p>
<p>"Poor little thing," said Miss Barrison, softly; "I don't know why,
  but I love that dog.... He has eyes like yours, Mr. Gilland—"</p>
<p>Exasperated, I rose from the table. "He's got eyes like holes burned
  in a blanket!" I said. "And if ever a flicker of intelligence lighted
  them I have failed to observe it."</p>
<p>The professor regarded me dreamily. "We ought to have more pies," he
  observed. "Perhaps if you carried the oven into the shanty—"</p>
<p>"Certainly," said Miss Barrison; "we can lock the door while I make
  twelve more pies."</p>
<p>I carried the portable camping-oven into the cabin, connected the
  patent asbestos chimney-pipes, and lighted the fire. And in a few
  minutes Miss Barrison, sleeves rolled up and pink apron pinned under
  her chin, was busily engaged in rolling pie-crust, while Professor
  Farrago measured out spices and set the dried apples to soak.</p>
<p>The swift Southern twilight had already veiled the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>forest as I
  stepped out of the cabin to smoke a cigar and promenade a bit and
  cogitate. A last trace of color lingering in the west faded out as I
  looked; the gray glimmer deepened into darkness, through which the
  white lake vapors floated in thin, wavering strata across the water.</p>
<p>For a while the frog's symphony dominated all other sounds, then
  lagoon and forest and cypress branch awoke; and through the steadily
  sustained tumult of woodland voices I could hear the dry bark of the
  fox-squirrel, the whistle of the raccoon, ducks softly quacking or
  whimpering as they prepared for sleep among the reeds, the soft
  booming of bitterns, the clattering gossip of the heronry, the
  Southern whippoorwill's incessant call.</p>
<p>At regular intervals the howling note of a lone heron echoed the
  strident screech of a crimson-crested crane; the horned owl's savage
  hunting-cry haunted the night, now near, now floating from infinite
  distances.</p>
<p>And after a while I became aware of a nearer sound, low-pitched but
  ceaseless—the hum of thousands of lesser living creatures blending to
  a steady monotone.</p>
<p>Then the theatrical moon came up through filmy draperies of waving
  Spanish moss thin as cobwebs; and far in the wilderness a cougar fell
  a-crying and coughing like a little child with a bad cold.</p>
<p>I went in after that. Miss Barrison was sitting before the oven, knees
  gathered in her clasped hands, languidly studying the fire. She looked
  up as I appeared, opened the oven-doors, sniffed the aroma, and
  resumed her attitude of contented indifference.</p>
<p>"Where is the professor?" I asked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>"He has retired. He's been talking in his sleep at moments."</p>
<p>"Better take it down; that's what you're here for," I observed,
  closing and holding the outside door. "Ugh! there's a chill in the
  air. The dew is pelting down from the pines like a steady fall of
  rain."</p>
<p>"You will get fever if you roam about at night," she said. "Mercy!
  your coat is soaking. Sit here by the fire."</p>
<p>So I pulled up a bench and sat down beside her like the traditional
  spider.</p>
<p>"Miss Muffitt," I said, "don't let me frighten you away—"</p>
<p>"I was going anyhow—"</p>
<p>"Please don't."</p>
<p>"Why?" she demanded, reseating herself.</p>
<p>"Because I like to sit beside you," I said, truthfully.</p>
<p>"Your avowal is startling and not to be substantiated by facts," she
  remarked, resting her chin on one hand and gazing into the fire.</p>
<p>"You mean because I went for a stroll by moonlight? I did that because
  you always seem to make fun of me as soon as the professor joins us."</p>
<p>"Make fun of you? You surely don't expect me to make eyes at you!"</p>
<p>There was a silence; I toasted my shins, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"How is your burned finger?" I asked.</p>
<p>She lifted it for my inspection, and I began a protracted examination.</p>
<p>"What would you prescribe?" she inquired, with an absent-minded glance
  at the professor's closed door.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>"I don't know; perhaps a slight but firm pressure of the
  finger-tips—"</p>
<p>"You tried that this afternoon."</p>
<p>"But the dog interrupted us—"</p>
<p>"Interrupted <i>you</i>. Besides—"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I don't think you ought to," she said.</p>
<p>Sitting there before the oven, side by side, hand innocently clasped
  in hand, we heard the drumming of the dew on the roof, the night-wind
  stirring the palms, the muffled snoring of the professor, the faint
  whisper and crackle of the fire.</p>
<p>A single candle burned brightly, piling our shadows together on the
  wall behind us; moonlight silvered the window-panes, over which
  crawled multitudes of soft-winged moths, attracted by the candle
  within.</p>
<p>"See their tiny eyes glow!" she whispered. "How their wings quiver!
  And all for a candle-flame! Alas! alas! fire is the undoing of us
  all."</p>
<p>She leaned forward, resting as though buried in reverie. After a while
  she extended one foot a trifle and, with the point of her shoe,
  carefully unlatched the oven-door. As it swung outward a delicious
  fragrance filled the room.</p>
<p>"They're done," she said, withdrawing her hand from mine. "Help me to
  lift them out."</p>
<p>Together we arranged the delicious pastry in rows on the bench to
  cool. I opened the door for a few minutes, then closed and bolted it
  again.</p>
<p>"Do you suppose those transparent creatures will smell the odor and
  come around the cabin?" she suggested, wiping her fingers on her
  handkerchief.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>I walked to the window uneasily. Outside the pane the moths crawled,
  some brilliant in scarlet and tan-color set with black, some
  snow-white with black tracings on their wings, and bodies peacock-blue
  edged with orange. The scientist in me was aroused; I called her to
  the window, and she came and leaned against the sill, nose pressed to
  the glass.</p>
<p>"I don't suppose you know that the antennæ of that silvery-winged moth
  are distinctly pectinate," I said.</p>
<p>"Of course I do," she said. "I took my degree as D.E. at Barnard
  College."</p>
<p>"What!" I exclaimed in astonishment. "You've been through Barnard? You
  are a Doctor of Entomology?"</p>
<p>"It was my undoing," she said. "The department was abolished the year
  I graduated. There was no similar vacancy, even in the Smithsonian."</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders, eyes fixed on the moths. "I had to make my
  own living. I chose stenography as the quickest road to
  self-sustenance."</p>
<p>She looked up, a flush on her cheeks.</p>
<p>"I suppose you took me for an inferior?" she said. "But do you suppose
  I'd flirt with you if I was?"</p>
<p>She pressed her face to the pane again, murmuring that exquisite poem
  of Andrew Lang:</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">"Spooning is innocuous and needn't have a sequel,<br></span>
  <span class="i0">  But recollect, if spoon you must, spoon only with your equal."<br></span>
</div></div>
<p>Standing there, watching the moths, we became rather silent—I don't
  know why.</p>
<p>The fire in the range had gone out; the candle-flame, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>flaring above a
  saucer of melted wax, sank lower and lower.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as though disturbed by something inside, the moths all left
  the window-pane, darting off in the darkness.</p>
<p>"That's curious," I said.</p>
<p>"What's curious?" she asked, opening her eyes languidly. "Good
  gracious! Was that a bat that beat on the window?"</p>
<p>"I saw nothing," I said, disturbed. "Listen!"</p>
<p>A soft sound against the glass, as though invisible fingers were
  feeling the pane—a gentle rubbing—then a tap-tap, all but inaudible.</p>
<p>"Is it a bird? Can you see?" she whispered.</p>
<p>The candle-flame behind us flashed and expired. Moonlight flooded the
  pane. The sounds continued, but there was nothing there.</p>
<p>We understood now what it was that so gently rubbed and patted the
  glass outside. With one accord we noiselessly gathered up the pies and
  carried them into my room.</p>
<p>Then she walked to the door of her room, turned, held out her hand,
  and whispering, "Good-night! A demain, monsieur!" slipped into her
  room and softly closed the door.</p>
<p>And all night long I lay in troubled slumber beside the pies, a rifle
  resting on the blankets beside me, a revolver under my pillow. And I
  dreamed of moths with brilliant eyes and vast silvery wings harnessed
  to a balloon in which Miss Barrison and I sat, arms around each other,
  eating slice after slice of apple-pie.</p>

</p><h3>XVII<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc" class="pginternal">ToC</a></span></h3>
<p><br>
</p><p>Dawn came—the dawn of a day that I am destined never to forget. Long,
  rosy streamers of light broke through the forest, shaking, quivering,
  like unstable beams from celestial search-lights. Mist floated upward
  from marsh and lake; and through it the spectral palms loomed,
  drooping fronds embroidered with dew.</p>
<p>For a while the ringing outburst of bird music dominated all; but it
  soon ceased with dropping notes from the crimson cardinals repeated in
  lengthening minor intervals; and then the spell of silence returned,
  broken only by the faint splash of mullet, mocking the sun with
  sinuous, silver flashes.</p>
<p>"Good-morning," said a low voice from the door as I stood encouraging
  the camp-fire with splinter wood and dead palmetto fans.</p>
<p>Fresh and sweet from her toilet as a dew-drenched rose, Miss Barrison
  stood there sniffing the morning air daintily, thoroughly.</p>
<p>"Too much perfume," she said—"too much like ylang-ylang in a
  department-store. Central Park smells sweeter on an April morning."</p>
<p>"Are you criticising the wild jasmine?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I'm criticising an exotic smell. Am I not permitted to comment on the
  tropics?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>Fishing out a cedar log from the lumber-stack, I fell to chopping it
  vigorously. The axe-strokes made a cheerful racket through the woods.</p>
<p>"Did you hear anything last night after you retired?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Something was at my window—something that thumped softly and seemed
  to be feeling all over the glass. To tell you the truth, I was silly
  enough to remain dressed all night."</p>
<p>"You don't look it," I said.</p>
<p>"Oh, when daylight came I had a chance," she added, laughing.</p>
<p>"All the same," said I, leaning on the axe and watching her, "you are
  about the coolest and pluckiest woman I ever knew."</p>
<p>"We were all in the same fix," she said, modestly.</p>
<p>"No, we were not. Now I'll tell you the truth—my hair stood up the
  greater part of the night. You are looking upon a poltroon, Miss
  Barrison."</p>
<p>"Then there was something at your window, too?"</p>
<p>"Something? A dozen! They were monkeying with the sashes and panes all
  night long, and I imagined that I could hear them breathing—as though
  from effort of intense eagerness. Ouch! I came as near losing my nerve
  as I care to. I came within an ace of hurling those cursed pies
  through the window at them. I'd bolt to-day if I wasn't afraid to play
  the coward."</p>
<p>"Most people are brave for that reason," she said.</p>
<p>The dog, who had slept under my bunk, and who had contributed to my
  entertainment by sighing and moaning all night, now appeared ready for
  business—business in his case being the operation of feeding. I
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>presented him with a concentrated tablet, which he cautiously
  investigated and then rolled on.</p>
<p>"Nice testimonial for the people who concocted it," I said, in
  disgust. "I wish I had an egg."</p>
<p>"There are some concentrated egg tablets in the shanty," said Miss
  Barrison; but the idea was not attractive.</p>
<p>"I refuse to fry a pill for breakfast," I said, sullenly, and set the
  coffee-pot on the coals.</p>
<p>In spite of the dewy beauty of the morning, breakfast was not a
  cheerful function. Professor Farrago appeared, clad in sun-helmet and
  khaki. I had seldom seen him depressed; but he was now, and his very
  efforts to disguise it only emphasized his visible anxiety.</p>
<p>His preparations for the day, too, had an ominous aspect to me. He
  gave his orders and we obeyed, instinctively suppressing questions.
  First, he and I transported all personal luggage of the company to the
  big electric launch—Miss Barrison's effects, his, and my own. His
  private papers, the stenographic reports, and all memoranda were tied
  up together and carried aboard.</p>
<p>Then, to my surprise, two weeks' concentrated rations for two and
  mineral water sufficient for the same period were stowed away aboard
  the launch. Several times he asked me whether I knew how to run the
  boat, and I assured him that I did.</p>
<p>In a short time nothing was left ashore except the bare furnishings of
  the cabin, the female wearing-apparel, the steel cage and chemicals
  which I had brought, and the twelve apple-pies—the latter under lock
  and key in my room.</p>
<p>As the preparations came to an end, the professor's <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>gentle melancholy
  seemed to deepen. Once I ventured to ask him if he was indisposed, and
  he replied that he had never felt in better physical condition.</p>
<p>Presently he bade me fetch the pies; and I brought them, and, at a
  sign from him, placed them inside the steel cage, closing and locking
  the door.</p>
<p>"I believe," he said, glancing from Miss Barrison to me, and from me
  to the dog—"I believe that we are ready to start."</p>
<p>He went to the cabin and locked the door on the outside, pocketing the
  key.</p>
<p>Then he backed up to the steel cage, stooped and lifted his end as I
  lifted mine, and together we started off through the forest, bearing
  the cage between us as porters carry a heavy piece of luggage.</p>
<p>Miss Barrison came next, carrying the trousseau, the tank, hose, and
  chemicals; and the dog followed her—probably not from affection for
  us, but because he was afraid to be left alone.</p>
<p>We walked in silence, the professor and I keeping an instinctive
  lookout for snakes; but we encountered nothing of that sort. On every
  side, touching our shoulders, crowded the closely woven and
  impenetrable tangle of the jungle; and we threaded it along a narrow
  path which he, no doubt, had cut, for the machete marks were still
  fresh, and the blazes on hickory, live-oak, and palm were all wet with
  dripping sap, and swarming with eager, brilliant butterflies.</p>
<p>At times across our course flowed shallow, rapid streams of water,
  clear as crystal, and most alluring to the thirsty.</p>
<p>"There's fever in every drop," said the professor, as I <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>mentioned my
  thirst; "take the bottled water if you mean to stay a little longer."</p>
<p>"Stay where?" I asked.</p>
<p>"On earth," he replied, tersely; and we marched on.</p>
<p>The beauty of the tropics is marred somewhat for me; under all the
  fresh splendor of color death lurks in brilliant tints. Where painted
  fruit hangs temptingly, where great, silky blossoms exhale alluring
  scent, where the elaps coils inlaid with scarlet, black, and saffron,
  where in the shadow of a palmetto frond a succession of velvety black
  diamonds mark the rattler's swollen length, there death is; and his
  invisible consort, horror, creeps where the snake whose mouth is lined
  with white creeps—where the tarantula squats, hairy, motionless;
  where a bit of living enamel fringed with orange undulates along a
  mossy log.</p>
<p>Thinking of these things, and watchful lest, unawares, terror unfold
  from some blossoming and leafy covert, I scarcely noticed the beauty
  of the glade we had entered—a long oval, cross-barred with sunshine
  which fell on hedges of scrub-palmetto, chin high, interlaced with
  golden blossoms of the jasmine. And all around, like pillars
  supporting a high green canopy above a throne, towered the silvery
  stems of palms fretted with pale, rose-tinted lichens and hung with
  draperies of grape-vine.</p>
<p>"This is the place," said Professor Farrago.</p>
<p>His quiet, passionless voice sounded strange to me; his words seemed
  strange, too, each one heavily weighted with hidden meaning.</p>
<p>We set the cage on the ground; he unlocked and opened the steel-barred
  door, and, kneeling, carefully arranged the pies along the centre of
  the cage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>"I have a curious presentiment," he said, "that I shall not come out
  of this experiment unscathed."</p>
<p>"Don't, for Heaven's sake, say that!" I broke out, my nerves on edge
  again.</p>
<p>"Why not?" he asked, surprised. "I am not afraid."</p>
<p>"Not afraid to die?" I demanded, exasperated.</p>
<p>"Who spoke of dying?" he inquired, mildly. "What I said was that I do
  not expect to come out of this affair unscathed."</p>
<p>I did not comprehend his meaning, but I understood the reproof
  conveyed.</p>
<p>He closed and locked the cage door again and came towards us,
  balancing the key across the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>Miss Barrison had seated herself on the leaves; I stood back as the
  professor sat down beside her; then, at a gesture from him, took the
  place he indicated on his left.</p>
<p>"Before we begin," he said, calmly, "there are several things you
  ought to know and which I have not yet told you. The first concerns
  the feminine wearing apparel which Mr. Gilland brought me."</p>
<p>He turned to Miss Barrison and asked her whether she had brought a
  complete outfit, and she opened the bundle on her knees and handed it
  to him.</p>
<p>"I cannot," he said, "delicately explain in so many words what use I
  expect to make of this apparel. Nor do I yet know whether I shall have
  any use at all for it. That can only be a theoretical speculation
  until, within a few more hours, my theory is proven or disproven—and,"
  he said, suddenly turning on me, "my theory concerning these invisible
  creatures is the most <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>extraordinary and audacious theory ever
  entertained by man since Columbus presumed that there must lie
  somewhere a hidden continent which nobody had ever seen."</p>
<p>He passed his hand over his protruding forehead, lost for a moment in
  deepest reflection. Then, "Have you ever heard of the Sphyx?" he
  asked.</p>
<p>"It seems to me that Ponce de Leon wrote of something—" I began,
  hesitating.</p>
<p>"Yes, the famous lines in the third volume which have set so many wise
  men guessing. You recall them:</p>
<p>"'<i>And there, alas! within sound of the Fountain of Youth whose waters
  tint the skin till the whole body glows softly like the petal of a
  rose—there, alas! in the new world already blooming</i>, <span class="sc">The Eternal
Enigma</span> <i>I beheld, in the flesh living; yet it faded even as I
  looked, although I swear it lived and breathed. This is the Sphyx</i>.'"</p>
<p>A silence; then I said, "Those lines are meaningless to me."</p>
<p>"Not to me," said Miss Barrison, softly.</p>
<p>The professor looked at her. "Ah, child! Ever subtler, ever surer—the
  Eternal Enigma is no enigma to you."</p>
<p>"What is the Sphyx?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Have you read De Soto? Or Goya?"</p>
<p>"Yes, both. I remember now that De Soto records the Syachas legend of
  the Sphyx—something about a goddess—"</p>
<p>"Not a goddess," said Miss Barrison, her lips touched with a smile.</p>
<p>"Sometimes," said the professor, gently. "And Goya said:</p>
<p>"'<i>It has come to my ears while in the lands of the Syachas</i> <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[171]</a></span><i>that the
  Sphyx surely lives, as bolder and more curious men than I may, God
  willing, prove to the world hereafter</i>.'"</p>
<p>"But what is the Sphyx?" I insisted.</p>
<p>"For centuries wise men and savants have asked each other that
  question. I have answered it for myself; I am now to prove it, I
  trust."</p>
<p>His face darkened, and again and again he stroked his heavy brow.</p>
<p>"If anything occurs," he said, taking my hand in his left and Miss
  Barrison's hand in his right, "promise me to obey my wishes. Will
  you?"</p>
<p>"Yes," we said, together.</p>
<p>"If I lose my life, or—or disappear, promise me on your honor to get
  to the electric launch as soon as possible and make all speed
  northward, placing my private papers, the reports of Miss Barrison,
  and your own reports in the hands of the authorities in Bronx Park.
  Don't attempt to aid me; don't delay to search for me. Do you
  promise?"</p>
<p>"Yes," we breathed together.</p>
<p>He looked at us solemnly. "If you fail me, you betray me," he said.</p>
<p>We swore obedience.</p>
<p>"Then let us begin," he said, and he rose and went to the steel cage.
  Unlocking the door, he flung it wide and stepped inside, leaving the
  cage door open.</p>
<p>"The moment a single pie is disturbed," he said to me, "I shall close
  the steel door from the inside, and you and Miss Barrison will then
  dump the rosium oxide and the strontium into the tank, clap on the
  lid, turn the nozzle of the hose on the cage, and spray it
  thoroughly. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>Whatever is invisible in the cage will become visible and
  of a faint rose color. And when the trapped creature becomes visible,
  hold yourselves ready to aid me as long as I am able to give you
  orders. After that either all will go well or all will go otherwise,
  and you must run for the launch." He seated himself in the cage near
  the open door.</p>
<p>I placed the steel tank near the cage, uncoiled the hose attachment,
  unscrewed the top, and dumped in the salts of strontium. Miss Barrison
  unwrapped the bottle of rosium oxide and loosened the cork. We
  examined this pearl-and-pink powder and shook it up so that it might
  run out quickly. Then Miss Barrison sat down, and presently became
  absorbed in a stenographic report of the proceedings up to date.</p>
<p>When Miss Barrison finished her report she handed me the bundle of
  papers. I stowed them away in my wallet, and we sat down together
  beside the tank.</p>
<p>Inside the cage Professor Farrago was seated, his spectacled eyes
  fixed on the row of pies. For a while, although realizing perfectly
  that our quarry was transparent and invisible, we unconsciously
  strained our eyes in quest of something stirring in the forest.</p>
<p>"I should think," said I, in a low voice, "that the odor of the pies
  might draw at least one out of the odd dozen that came rubbing up
  against my window last night."</p>
<p>"Hush! Listen!" she breathed. But we heard nothing save the snoring of
  the overfed dog at our feet.</p>
<p>"He'll give us ample notice by butting into Miss Barrison's skirts," I
  observed. "No need of our watching, professor."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>The professor nodded. Presently he removed his spectacles and lay back
  against the bars, closing his eyes.</p>
<p>At first the forest silence seemed cheerful there in the flecked
  sunlight. The spotted wood-gnats gyrated merrily, chased by
  dragon-flies; the shy wood-birds hopped from branch to twig, peering
  at us in friendly inquiry; a lithe, gray squirrel, plumy tail
  undulating, rambled serenely around the cage, sniffing at the pastry
  within.</p>
<p>Suddenly, without apparent reason, the squirrel sprang to a
  tree-trunk, hung a moment on the bark, quivering all over, then dashed
  away into the jungle.</p>
<p>"Why did he act like that?" whispered Miss Barrison. And, after a
  moment: "How still it is! Where have the birds gone?"</p>
<p>In the ominous silence the dog began to whimper in his sleep and his
  hind legs kicked convulsively.</p>
<p>"He's dreaming—" I began.</p>
<p>The words were almost driven down my throat by the dog, who, without a
  yelp of warning, hurled himself at Miss Barrison and alighted on my
  chest, fore paws around my neck.</p>
<p>I cast him scornfully from me, but he scrambled back, digging like a
  mole to get under us.</p>
<p>"The transparent creatures!" whispered Miss Barrison. "Look! See that
  pie move!"</p>
<p>I sprang to my feet just as the professor, jamming on his spectacles,
  leaned forward and slammed the cage door.</p>
<p>"I've got one!" he shouted, frantically. "There's one in the cage!
  Turn on that hose!"</p>
<p>"Wait a second," said Miss Barrison, calmly, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>uncorking the bottle and
  pouring a pearly stream of rosium oxide into the tank. "Quick! It's
  fizzing! Screw on the top!"</p>
<p>In a second I had screwed the top fast, seized the hose, and directed
  a hissing cloud of vapor through the cage bars.</p>
<p>For a moment nothing was heard save the whistling rush of the perfumed
  spray escaping; a delicious odor of roses filled the air. Then,
  slowly, there in the sunshine, a misty something grew in the cage—a
  glistening, pearl-tinted phantom, imperceptibly taking shape in
  space—vague at first as a shred of lake vapor, then lengthening,
  rounding into flowing form, clearer, clearer.</p>
<p>"The Sphyx!" gasped the professor. "In the name of Heaven, play that
  hose!"</p>
<p>As he spoke the treacherous hose burst. A showery pillar of
  rose-colored vapor enveloped everything. Through the thickening fog
  for one brief instant a human form appeared like magic—a woman's
  form, flawless, exquisite as a statue, pure as marble. Then the
  swimming vapor buried it, cage, pies, and all.</p>
<p>We ran frantically around, the cage in the obscurity, appealing for
  instructions and feeling for the bars. Once the professor's muffled
  voice was heard demanding the wearing apparel, and I groped about and
  found it and stuffed it through the bars of the cage.</p>
<p>"Do you need help?" I shouted. There was no response. Staring around
  through the thickening vapor of rosium rolling in clouds from the
  overturned tank, I heard Miss Barrison's voice calling:</p>
<p>"I can't move! A transparent lady is holding me!"</p>
<p>Blindly I rushed about, arms outstretched, and the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>next moment struck
  the door of the cage so hard that the impact almost knocked me
  senseless. Clutching it to steady myself, it suddenly flew open. A
  rush of partly visible creatures passed me like a burst of pink
  flames, and in the midst, borne swiftly away on the crest of the
  outrush, the professor passed like a bolt shot from a catapult; and
  his last cry came wafted back to me from the forest as I swayed there,
  drunk with the stupefying perfume: "Don't worry! I'm all right!"</p>
<p>I staggered out into the clearer air towards a figure seen dimly
  through swirling vapor.</p>
<p>"Are you hurt?" I stammered, clasping Miss Barrison in my arms.</p>
<p>"No—oh no," she said, wringing her hands. "But the professor! I saw
  him! I could not scream; I could not move! <i>They</i> had him!"</p>
<p>"I saw him too," I groaned. "There was not one trace of terror on his
  face. He was actually smiling."</p>
<p>Overcome at the sublime courage of the man, we wept in each other's
  arms.</p>
<hr style="width: 15%; padding-top: 1.25em; padding-bottom: 1.25em;">
<p>True to our promise to Professor Farrago, we made the best of our way
  northward; and it was not a difficult journey by any means, the voyage
  in the launch across Okeechobee being perfectly simple and the trail
  to the nearest railroad station but a few easy miles from the
  landing-place.</p>
<p>Shocking as had been our experience, dreadful as was the calamity
  which had not only robbed me of a life-long friend, but had also
  bereaved the entire scientific world, I could not seem to feel that
  desperate and hopeless grief which the natural decease of a close
  friend might <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>warrant. No; there remained a vague expectancy which so
  dominated my sorrow that at moments I became hopeful—nay, sanguine,
  that I should one day again behold my beloved superior in the flesh.
  There was something so happy in his last smile, something so artlessly
  pleased, that I was certain no fear of impending dissolution worried
  him as he disappeared into the uncharted depth of the unknown
  Everglades.</p>
<p>I think Miss Barrison agreed with me, too. She appeared to be more or
  less dazed, which was, of course, quite natural; and during our return
  voyage across Okeechobee and through the lagoons and forests beyond
  she was very silent.</p>
<p>When we reached the railroad at Portulacca, a thrifty lemon-growing
  ranch on the Volusia and Chinkapin Railway, the first thing I did was
  to present my dog to the station-agent—but I was obliged to give him
  five dollars before he consented to accept the dog.</p>
<p>However, Miss Barrison interviewed the station-master's wife, a
  kindly, pitiful soul, who promised to be a good mistress to the
  creature. We both felt better after that was off our minds; we felt
  better still when the north-bound train rolled leisurely into the
  white glare of Portulacca, and presently rolled out again, quite as
  leisurely, bound, thank Heaven, for that abused aggregation of sinful
  boroughs called New York.</p>
<p>Except for one young man whom I encountered in the smoker, we had the
  train to ourselves, a circumstance which, curiously enough, appeared
  to increase Miss Barrison's depression, and my own as a natural
  sequence. The circumstances of the taking off of Professor Farrago
  appeared to engross her thoughts so completely that it <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>made me uneasy
  during our trip out from Little Sprite—in fact it was growing plainer
  to me every hour that in her brief acquaintance with that
  distinguished scientist she had become personally attached to him to
  an extent that began to worry me. Her personal indignation at the
  caged Sphyx flared out at unexpected intervals, and there could be no
  doubt that her unhappiness and resentment were becoming morbid.</p>
<p>I spent an hour or two in the smoking compartment, tenanted only by a
  single passenger and myself. He was an agreeable young man, although,
  in the natural acquaintanceship that we struck up, I regretted to
  learn that he was a writer of popular fiction, returning from Fort
  Worth, where he had been for the sole purpose of composing a poem on
  Florida.</p>
<p>I have always, in common with other mentally balanced savants,
  despised writers of fiction. All scientists harbor a natural antipathy
  to romance in any form, and that antipathy becomes a deep horror if
  fiction dares to deal flippantly with the exact sciences, or if some
  degraded intellect assumes the warrantless liberty of using natural
  history as the vehicle for silly tales.</p>
<p>Never but once had I been tempted to romance in any form; never but
  once had sentiment interfered with a passionless transfer of
  scientific notes to the sanctuary of the unvarnished note-book or the
  cloister of the juiceless monograph. Nor have I the slightest approach
  to that superficial and doubtful quality known as literary skill.
  Once, however, as I sat alone in the middle of the floor, classifying
  my isopods, I was not only astonished but totally unprepared to find
  myself <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>repeating aloud a verse that I myself had unconsciously
  fashioned:</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
  <span class="i0">"An isopod<br></span>
  <span class="i0">  Is a work of God."<br></span>
</div></div>
<p class="noin">Never before in all my life had I made a rhyme; and it worried me for
  weeks, ringing in my brain day and night, confusing me, interfering
  with my thoughts.</p>
<p>I said as much to the young man, who only laughed good-naturedly and
  replied that it was the Creator's purpose to limit certain intellects,
  nobody knows why, and that it was apparent that mine had not escaped.</p>
<p>"There's one thing, however," he said, "that might be of some interest
  to you and come within the circumscribed scope of your intelligence."</p>
<p>"And what is that?" I asked, tartly.</p>
<p>"A scientific experience of mine," he said, with a careless laugh.
  "It's so much stranger than fiction that even Professor Bruce
  Stoddard, of Columbia, hesitated to credit it."</p>
<p>I looked at the young fellow suspiciously. His bland smile disarmed
  me, but I did not invite him to relate his experience, although he
  apparently needed only that encouragement to begin.</p>
<p>"Now, if I could tell it exactly as it occurred," he observed, "and a
  stenographer could take it down, word for word, exactly as I relate
  it—"</p>
<p>"It would give me great pleasure to do so," said a quiet voice at the
  door. We rose at once, removing the cigars from our lips; but Miss
  Barrison bade us continue smoking, and at a gesture from her we
  resumed our seats after she had installed herself by the window.</p>
<p>"Really," she said, looking coldly at me, "I couldn't <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>endure the
  solitude any longer. Isn't there anything to do on this tiresome
  train?"</p>
<p>"If you had your pad and pencil," I began, maliciously, "you might
  take down a matter of interest—"</p>
<p>She looked frankly at the young man, who laughed in that pleasant,
  good-tempered manner of his, and offered to tell us of his alleged
  scientific experience if we thought it might amuse us sufficiently to
  vary the dull monotony of the journey north.</p>
<p>"Is it fiction?" I asked, point-blank.</p>
<p>"It is absolute truth," he replied.</p>
<p>I rose and went off to find pad and pencil. When I returned Miss
  Barrison was laughing at a story which the young man had just
  finished.</p>
<p>"But," he ended, gravely, "I have practically decided to renounce
  fiction as a means of livelihood and confine myself to simple,
  uninteresting statistics and facts."</p>
<p>"I am very glad to hear you say that," I exclaimed, warmly. He bowed,
  looked at Miss Barrison, and asked her when he might begin his story.</p>
<p>"Whenever you are ready," replied Miss Barrison, smiling in a manner
  which I had not observed since the disappearance of Professor Farrago.
  I'll admit that the young fellow was superficially attractive.</p>
<p>"Well, then," he began, modestly, "having no technical ability
  concerning the affair in question, and having no knowledge of either
  comparative anatomy or zoology, I am perhaps unfitted to tell this
  story. But the story is true; the episode occurred under my own
  eyes—within a few hours' sail of the Battery. And as I was one of the
  first persons to verify what has long been a theory among scientists,
  and, moreover, as the result of <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>Professor Holroyd's discovery is to
  be placed on exhibition in Madison Square Garden on the 20th of next
  month, I have decided to tell you, as simply as I am able, exactly
  what occurred.</p>
<p>"I first told the story on April 1, 1903, to the editors of the <i>North
  American Review</i>, <i>The Popular Science Monthly</i>, the <i>Scientific
  American</i>, <i>Nature</i>, <i>Outing</i>, and the <i>Fossiliferous Magazine</i>. All
  these gentlemen rejected it; some curtly informing me that fiction had
  no place in their columns. When I attempted to explain that it was not
  fiction, the editors of these periodicals either maintained a
  contemptuous silence, or bluntly notified me that my literary services
  and opinions were not desired. But finally, when several publishers
  offered to take the story as fiction, I cut short all negotiations and
  decided to publish it myself. Where I am known at all, it is my
  misfortune to be known as a writer of fiction. This makes it
  impossible for me to receive a hearing from a scientific audience. I
  regret it bitterly, because now, when it is too late, I am prepared to
  prove certain scientific matters of interest, and to produce the
  proofs. In this case, however, I am fortunate, for nobody can dispute
  the existence of a thing when the bodily proof is exhibited as
  evidence.</p>
<p>"This is the story; and if I tell it as I write fiction, it is because
  I do not know how to tell it otherwise.</p>
<p>"I was walking along the beach below Pine Inlet, on the south shore of
  Long Island. The railroad and telegraph station is at West Oyster Bay.
  Everybody who has travelled on the Long Island Railroad knows the
  station, but few, perhaps, know Pine Inlet. Duck-shooters, of course,
  are familiar with it; but as there are <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>no hotels there, and nothing
  to see except salt meadow, salt creek, and a strip of dune and sand,
  the summer-squatting public may probably be unaware of its existence.
  The local name for the place is Pine Inlet; the maps give its name as
  Sand Point, I believe, but anybody at West Oyster Bay can direct you
  to it. Captain McPeek, who keeps the West Oyster Bay House, drives
  duck-shooters there in winter. It lies five miles southeast from West
  Oyster Bay.</p>
<p>"I had walked over that afternoon from Captain McPeek's. There was a
  reason for my going to Pine Inlet—it embarrasses me to explain it,
  but the truth is I meditated writing an ode to the ocean. It was out
  of the question to write it in West Oyster Bay, with the whistle of
  locomotives in my ears. I knew that Pine Inlet was one of the
  loneliest places on the Atlantic coast; it is out of sight of
  everything except leagues of gray ocean. Rarely one might make out
  fishing-smacks drifting across the horizon. Summer squatters never
  visited it; sportsmen shunned it, except in winter. Therefore, as I
  was about to do a bit of poetry, I thought that Pine Inlet was the
  spot for the deed. So I went there.</p>
<p>"As I was strolling along the beach, biting my pencil reflectively,
  tremendously impressed by the solitude and the solemn thunder of the
  surf, a thought occurred to me—how unpleasant it would be if I
  suddenly stumbled on a summer boarder. As this joyless impossibility
  flitted across my mind, I rounded a bleak sand-dune.</p>
<p>"A girl stood directly in my path.</p>
<p>"She stared at me as though I had just crawled up out of the sea to
  bite her. I don't know what my own <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>expression resembled, but I have
  been given to understand it was idiotic.</p>
<p>"Now I perceived, after a few moments, that the young lady was
  frightened, and I knew I ought to say something civil. So I said, 'Are
  there many mosquitoes here?'</p>
<p>"'No,' she replied, with a slight quiver in her voice; 'I have only
  seen one, and it was biting somebody else.'</p>
<p>"The conversation seemed so futile, and the young lady appeared to be
  more nervous than before. I had an impulse to say, 'Do not run; I have
  breakfasted,' for she seemed to be meditating a flight into the
  breakers. What I did say was: 'I did not know anybody was here. I do
  not intend to intrude. I come from Captain McPeek's, and I am writing
  an ode to the ocean.' After I had said this it seemed to ring in my
  ears like, 'I come from Table Mountain, and my name is Truthful
  James.'</p>
<p>"I glanced timidly at her.</p>
<p>"'She's thinking of the same thing,' said I to myself.</p>
<p>"However, the young lady seemed to be a trifle reassured. I noticed
  she drew a sigh of relief and looked at my shoes. She looked so long
  that it made me suspicious, and I also examined my shoes. They seemed
  to be in a fair state of repair.</p>
<p>"'I—I am sorry,' she said, 'but would you mind not walking on the
  beach?'</p>
<p>"This was sudden. I had intended to retire and leave the beach to her,
  but I did not fancy being driven away so abruptly.</p>
<p>"'Dear me!' she cried; 'you don't understand. I do not—I would not
  think for a moment of asking you to <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>leave Pine Inlet. I merely
  ventured to request you to walk on the dunes. I am so afraid that your
  footprints may obliterate the impressions that my father is studying.'</p>
<p>"'Oh!' said I, looking about me as though I had been caught in the
  middle of a flower-bed; 'really I did not notice any impressions.
  Impressions of what?'</p>
<p>"'I don't know,' she said, smiling a little at my awkward pose. 'If
  you step this way in a straight line you can do no damage.'</p>
<p>"I did as she bade me. I suppose my movements resembled the gait of a
  wet peacock. Possibly they recalled the delicate manœuvres of the
  kangaroo. Anyway, she laughed.</p>
<p>"This seriously annoyed me. I had been at a disadvantage; I walk well
  enough when let alone.</p>
<p>"'You can scarcely expect,' said I, 'that a man absorbed in his own
  ideas could notice impressions on the sand. I trust I have obliterated
  nothing.'</p>
<p>"As I said this I looked back at the long line of footprints
  stretching away in prospective across the sand. They were my own. How
  large they looked! Was that what she was laughing at?</p>
<p>"'I wish to explain,' she said, gravely, looking at the point of her
  parasol. 'I am very sorry to be obliged to warn you—to ask you to
  forego the pleasure of strolling on a beach that does not belong to
  me. Perhaps,' she continued, in sudden alarm, 'perhaps this beach
  belongs to you?'</p>
<p>"'The beach? Oh no,' I said.</p>
<p>"'But—but you were going to write poems about it?'</p>
<p>"'Only one—and that does not necessitate owning the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>beach. I have
  observed,' said I, frankly, 'that the people who own nothing write
  many poems about it.'</p>
<p>"She looked at me seriously.</p>
<p>"'I write many poems,' I added.</p>
<p>"She laughed doubtfully.</p>
<p>"'Would you rather I went away?' I asked, politely. 'My family is
  respectable,' I added; and I told her my name.</p>
<p>"'Oh! Then you wrote <i>Culled Cowslips</i> and <i>Faded Fig-Leaves</i> and you
  imitate Maeterlinck, and you—Oh, I know lots of people that you
  know;' she cried, with every symptom of relief; 'and you know my
  brother.'</p>
<p>"'I am the author,' said I, coldly, 'of <i>Culled Cowslips</i>, but <i>Faded
  Fig-Leaves</i> was an earlier work, which I no longer recognize, and I
  should be grateful to you if you would be kind enough to deny that I
  ever imitated Maeterlinck. Possibly,' I added, 'he imitates me.'</p>
<p>"She was very quiet, and I saw she was sorry.</p>
<p>"'Never mind,' I said, magnanimously, 'you probably are not familiar
  with modern literature. If I knew your name I should ask permission to
  present myself.'</p>
<p>"'Why, I am Daisy Holroyd,' she said.</p>
<p>"'What! Jack Holroyd's little sister?'</p>
<p>"'Little?' she cried.</p>
<p>"'I didn't mean that,' said I. 'You know that your brother and I were
  great friends in Paris—'</p>
<p>"'I know,' she said, significantly.</p>
<p>"'Ahem! Of course,' I said, 'Jack and I were inseparable—'</p>
<p>"'Except when shut in separate cells,' said Miss Holroyd, coldly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>"This unfeeling allusion to the unfortunate termination of a
  Latin-Quarter celebration hurt me.</p>
<p>"'The police,' said I, 'were too officious.'</p>
<p>"'So Jack says,' replied Miss Holroyd, demurely.</p>
<p>"We had unconsciously moved on along the sand-hills, side by side, as
  we spoke.</p>
<p>"'To think,' I repeated, 'that I should meet Jack's little—'</p>
<p>"'Please,' she said, 'you are only three years my senior.'</p>
<p>"She opened the sunshade and tipped it over one shoulder. It was
  white, and had spots and posies on it.</p>
<p>"'Jack sends us every new book you write,' she observed. 'I do not
  approve of some things you write.'</p>
<p>"'Modern school,' I mumbled.</p>
<p>"'That is no excuse,' she said, severely; 'Anthony Trollope didn't do
  it.'</p>
<p>"The foam spume from the breakers was drifting across the dunes, and
  the little tip-up snipe ran along the beach and teetered and whistled
  and spread their white-barred wings for a low, straight flight across
  the shingle, only to tip and run and sail on again. The salt sea-wind
  whistled and curled through the crested waves, blowing in perfumed
  puffs across thickets of sweet bay and cedar. As we passed through the
  crackling juicy-stemmed marsh-weed myriads of fiddler crabs raised
  their fore-claws in warning and backed away, rustling, through the
  reeds, aggressive, protesting.</p>
<p>"'Like millions of pygmy Ajaxes defying the lightning,' I said.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>"Miss Holroyd laughed.</p>
<p>"'Now I never imagined that authors were clever except in print,' she
  said.</p>
<p>"She was a most extraordinary girl.</p>
<p>"'I suppose,' she observed, after a moment's silence—'I suppose I am
  taking you to my father.'</p>
<p>"'Delighted!' I mumbled. 'H'm! I had the honor of meeting Professor
  Holroyd in Paris.'</p>
<p>"'Yes; he bailed you and Jack out,' said Miss Holroyd, serenely.</p>
<p>"The silence was too painful to last.</p>
<p>"'Captain McPeek is an interesting man,' I said. I spoke more loudly
  than I intended. I may have been nervous.</p>
<p>"'Yes,' said Daisy Holroyd, 'but he has a most singular hotel clerk.'</p>
<p>"'You mean Mr. Frisby?'</p>
<p>"'I do.'</p>
<p>"'Yes,' I admitted, 'Mr. Frisby is queer. He was once a bill-poster.'</p>
<p>"'I know it!' exclaimed Daisy Holroyd, with some heat. 'He ruins
  landscapes whenever he has an opportunity. Do you know that he has a
  passion for bill-posting? He has; he posts bills for the pure pleasure
  of it, just as you play golf, or tennis, or squash.'</p>
<p>"'But he's a hotel clerk now,' I said; 'nobody employs him to post
  bills.'</p>
<p>"'I know it! He does it all by himself for the pure pleasure of it.
  Papa has engaged him to come down here for two weeks, and I dread it,'
  said the girl.</p>
<p>"What Professor Holroyd might want of Frisby I had <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>not the faintest
  notion. I suppose Miss Holroyd noticed the bewilderment in my face,
  for she laughed and nodded her head twice.</p>
<p>"'Not only Mr. Frisby, but Captain McPeek also,' she said.</p>
<p>"'You don't mean to say that Captain McPeek is going to close his
  hotel!' I exclaimed.</p>
<p>"My trunk was there. It contained guarantees of my respectability.</p>
<p>"'Oh no; his wife will keep it open,' replied the girl. 'Look! you can
  see papa now. He's digging.'</p>
<p>"'Where?' I blurted out.</p>
<p>"I remembered Professor Holroyd as a prim, spectacled gentleman, with
  close-cut, snowy beard and a clerical allure. The man I saw digging
  wore green goggles, a jersey, a battered sou'wester, and hip-boots of
  rubber. He was delving in the muck of the salt meadow, his face
  streaming with perspiration, his boots and jersey splashed with
  unpleasant-looking mud. He glanced up as we approached, shading his
  eyes with a sunburned hand.</p>
<p>"'Papa, dear,' said Miss Holroyd, 'here is Jack's friend, whom you
  bailed out of Mazas.'</p>
<p>"The introduction was startling. I turned crimson with mortification.
  The professor was very decent about it; he called me by name at once.
  Then he looked at his spade. It was clear he considered me a nuisance
  and wished to go on with his digging.</p>
<p>"'I suppose,' he said, 'you are still writing?'</p>
<p>"'A little,' I replied, trying not to speak sarcastically. My output
  had rivalled that of 'The Duchess'—in quantity, I mean.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>"'I seldom read—fiction,' he said, looking restlessly at the hole in
  the ground.</p>
<p>"Miss Holroyd came to my rescue.</p>
<p>"'That was a charming story you wrote last,' she said. 'Papa should
  read it—you should, papa; it's all about a fossil.'</p>
<p>"We both looked narrowly at Miss Holroyd. Her smile was guileless.</p>
<p>"'Fossils!' repeated the professor. 'Do you care for fossils?'</p>
<p>"'Very much,' said I.</p>
<p>"Now I am not perfectly sure what my object was in lying. I looked at
  Daisy Holroyd's dark-fringed eyes. They were very grave.</p>
<p>"'Fossils,' said I, 'are my hobby.'</p>
<p>"I think Miss Holroyd winced a little at this. I did not care. I went
  on:</p>
<p>"'I have seldom had the opportunity to study the subject, but, as a
  boy, I collected flint arrow-heads—"</p>
<p>"'Flint arrow-heads!' said the professor coldly.</p>
<p>"'Yes; they were the nearest things to fossils obtainable,' I replied,
  marvelling at my own mendacity.</p>
<p>"The professor looked into the hole. I also looked. I could see
  nothing in it. 'He's digging for fossils,' thought I to myself.</p>
<p>"'Perhaps,' said the professor, cautiously, 'you might wish to aid me
  in a little research—that is to say, if you have an inclination for
  fossils.' The double-entendre was not lost upon me.</p>
<p>"'I have read all your books so eagerly,' said I, 'that to join you,
  to be of service to you in any research, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>however difficult and
  trying, would be an honor and a privilege that I never dared to hope
  for.'</p>
<p>"'That,' thought I to myself, 'will do its own work.'</p>
<p>"But the professor was still suspicious. How could he help it, when he
  remembered Jack's escapades, in which my name was always blended!
  Doubtless he was satisfied that my influence on Jack was evil. The
  contrary was the case, too.</p>
<p>"'Fossils,' he said, worrying the edge of the excavation with his
  spade—'fossils are not things to be lightly considered.'</p>
<p>"'No, indeed!' I protested.</p>
<p>"'Fossils are the most interesting as well as puzzling things in the
  world,' said he.</p>
<p>"'They are!' I cried, enthusiastically.</p>
<p>"'But I am not looking for fossils,' observed the professor, mildly.</p>
<p>"This was a facer. I looked at Daisy Holroyd. She bit her lip and
  fixed her eyes on the sea. Her eyes were wonderful eyes.</p>
<p>"'Did you think I was digging for fossils in a salt meadow?' queried
  the professor. 'You can have read very little about the subject. I am
  digging for something quite different.'</p>
<p>"I was silent. I knew that my face was flushed. I longed to say,
  'Well, what the devil are you digging for?' but I only stared into the
  hole as though hypnotized.</p>
<p>"'Captain McPeek and Frisby ought to be here,' he said, looking first
  at Daisy and then across the meadows.</p>
<p>"I ached to ask him why he had subpœnaed Captain McPeek and
  Frisby.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>"'They are coming,' said Daisy, shading her eyes. 'Do you see the
  speck on the meadows?'</p>
<p>"'It may be a mud-hen,' said the professor.</p>
<p>"'Miss Holroyd is right,' I said. 'A wagon and team and two men are
  coming from the north. There's a dog beside the wagon—it's that
  miserable yellow dog of Frisby's.'</p>
<p>"'Good gracious!' cried the professor, 'you don't mean to tell me that
  you see all that at such a distance?'</p>
<p>"'Why not?' I said.</p>
<p>"'I see nothing,' he insisted.</p>
<p>"'You will see that I'm right, presently,' I laughed.</p>
<p>"The professor removed his blue goggles and rubbed them, glancing
  obliquely at me.</p>
<p>"'Haven't you heard what extraordinary eyesight duck-shooters have?'
  said his daughter, looking back at her father. 'Jack says that he can
  tell exactly what kind of a duck is flying before most people could
  see anything at all in the sky.'</p>
<p>"'It's true,' I said; 'it comes to anybody, I fancy, who has had
  practice.'</p>
<p>"The professor regarded me with a new interest. There was inspiration
  in his eyes. He turned towards the ocean. For a long time he stared at
  the tossing waves on the beach, then he looked far out to where the
  horizon met the sea.</p>
<p>"'Are there any ducks out there?' he asked, at last.</p>
<p>"'Yes,' said I, scanning the sea, 'there are.'</p>
<p>"He produced a pair of binoculars from his coat-tail pocket, adjusted
  them, and raised them to his eyes.</p>
<p>"'H'm! What sort of ducks?'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>"I looked more carefully, holding both hands over my forehead.</p>
<p>"'Surf-ducks and widgeon. There is one bufflehead among them—no, two;
  the rest are coots,' I replied.</p>
<p>"'This,' cried the professor, 'is most astonishing. I have good eyes,
  but I can't see a blessed thing without these binoculars!'</p>
<p>"'It's not extraordinary,' said I; 'the surf-ducks and coots any
  novice might recognize; the widgeon and buffleheads I should not have
  been able to name unless they had risen from the water. It is easy to
  tell any duck when it is flying, even though it looks no bigger than a
  black pin-point.'</p>
<p>"But the professor insisted that it was marvellous, and he said that I
  might render him invaluable service if I would consent to come and
  camp at Pine Inlet for a few weeks.</p>
<p>"I looked at his daughter, but she turned her back. Her back was
  beautifully moulded. Her gown fitted also.</p>
<p>"'Camp out here?' I repeated, pretending to be unpleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>"'I do not think he would care to,' said Miss Holroyd, without
  turning.</p>
<p>"I had not expected that.</p>
<p>"'Above all things,' said I, in a clear, pleasant voice, 'I like to
  camp out.'</p>
<p>"She said nothing.</p>
<p>"'It is not exactly camping,' said the professor. 'Come, you shall see
  our conservatory. Daisy, come, dear! You must put on a heavier frock;
  it is getting towards sundown.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>"At that moment, over a near dune, two horses' heads appeared,
  followed by two human heads, then a wagon, then a yellow dog.</p>
<p>"I turned triumphantly to the professor.</p>
<p>"'You are the very man I want,' he muttered—'the very man—the very
  man.'</p>
<p>"I looked at Daisy Holroyd. She returned my glance with a defiant
  little smile.</p>
<p>"'Waal,' said Captain McPeek, driving up, 'here we be! Git out,
  Frisby.'</p>
<p>"Frisby, fat, nervous, and sentimental, hopped out of the cart.</p>
<p>"'Come,' said the professor, impatiently moving across the dunes. I
  walked with Daisy Holroyd. McPeek and Frisby followed. The yellow dog
  walked by himself.</p>

<p><br>
</p><p>"The sun was dipping into the sea as we trudged across the meadows
  towards a high, dome-shaped dune covered with cedars and thickets of
  sweet bay. I saw no sign of habitation among the sand-hills. Far as
  the eye could reach, nothing broke the gray line of sea and sky save
  the squat dunes crowned with stunted cedars.</p>
<p>"Then, as we rounded the base of the dune, we almost walked into the
  door of a house. My amazement amused Miss Holroyd, and I noticed also
  a touch of malice in her pretty eyes. But she said nothing, following
  her father into the house, with the slightest possible gesture to me.
  Was it invitation or was it menace?</p>
<p>"The house was merely a light wooden frame, covered with some
  waterproof stuff that looked like a mixture of rubber and tar. Over
  this—in fact, over the whole roof—was pitched an awning of heavy
  sail-cloth. I noticed that the house was anchored to the sand by
  chains, already rusted red. But this one-storied house was not the
  only building nestling in the south shelter of the big dune. A hundred
  feet away stood another structure—long, low, also built of wood. It
  had rows on rows of round port-holes on every side. The ports were
  fitted with heavy glass, hinged to swing open if necessary. A single,
  big double door occupied the front.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>"Behind this long, low building was still another, a mere shed. Smoke
  rose from the sheet-iron chimney. There was somebody moving about
  inside the open door.</p>
<p>"As I stood gaping at this mushroom hamlet the professor appeared at
  the door and asked me to enter. I stepped in at once.</p>
<p>"The house was much larger than I had imagined. A straight hallway ran
  through the centre from east to west. On either side of this hallway
  were rooms, the doors swinging wide open. I counted three doors on
  each side; the three on the south appeared to be bedrooms.</p>
<p>"The professor ushered me into a room on the north side, where I found
  Captain McPeek and Frisby sitting at a table, upon which were drawings
  and sketches of articulated animals and fishes.</p>
<p>"'You see, McPeek,' said the professor, 'we only wanted one more man,
  and I think I've got him—Haven't I?' turning eagerly to me.</p>
<p>"'Why, yes,' I said, laughing; 'this is delightful. Am I invited to
  stay here?'</p>
<p>"'Your bedroom is the third on the south side; everything is ready.
  McPeek, you can bring his trunk to-morrow, can't you?' demanded the
  professor.</p>
<p>"The red-faced captain nodded, and shifted a quid.</p>
<p>"'Then it's all settled,' said the professor, and he drew a sigh of
  satisfaction. 'You see,' he said, turning to me, 'I was at my wit's
  end to know whom to trust. I never thought of you. Jack's out in
  China, and I didn't dare trust anybody in my own profession. All you
  care about is writing verses and stories, isn't it?'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>"'I like to shoot,' I replied, mildly.</p>
<p>"'Just the thing!' he cried, beaming at us all in turn. 'Now I can see
  no reason why we should not progress rapidly. McPeek, you and Frisby
  must get those boxes up here before dark. Dinner will be ready before
  you have finished unloading. Dick, you will wish to go to your room
  first.'</p>
<p>"My name isn't Dick, but he spoke so kindly, and beamed upon me in
  such a fatherly manner, that I let it go. I had occasion to correct
  him afterwards, several times, but he always forgot the next minute.
  He calls me Dick to this day.</p>
<p>"It was dark when Professor Holroyd, his daughter, and I sat down to
  dinner. The room was the same in which I had noticed the drawings of
  beast and bird, but the round table had been extended into an oval,
  and neatly spread with dainty linen and silver.</p>
<p>"A fresh-cheeked Swedish girl appeared from a farther room, bearing
  the soup. The professor ladled it out, still beaming.</p>
<p>"'Now, this is very delightful—isn't it, Daisy?' he said.</p>
<p>"'Very,' said Miss Holroyd, with a tinge of irony.</p>
<p>"'Very,' I repeated, heartily.</p>
<p>"'I suppose,' said the professor, nodding mysteriously at his
  daughter, 'that Dick knows nothing of what we're about down here?'</p>
<p>"'I suppose,' said Miss Holroyd, 'that he thinks we are digging for
  fossils.'</p>
<p>"I looked at my plate. She might have spared me that.</p>
<p>"'Well, well,' said her father, smiling to himself, 'he <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>shall know
  everything by morning. You'll be astonished, Dick, my boy.'</p>
<p>"'His name isn't Dick,' corrected Daisy.</p>
<p>"The professor said, 'Isn't it?' in an absent-minded way, and relapsed
  into contemplation of my necktie.</p>
<p>"I asked Miss Holroyd a few questions about Jack, and was informed
  that he had given up law and entered the consular service—as what, I
  did not dare ask, for I know what our consular service is.</p>
<p>"'In China,' said Daisy.</p>
<p>"'Choo Choo is the name of the city,' added her father, proudly; 'it's
  the terminus of the new trans-Siberian railway.'</p>
<p>"'It's on the Pong Ping,' said Daisy.</p>
<p>"'He's vice-consul,' added the professor, triumphantly.</p>
<p>"'He'll make a good one,' I observed. I knew Jack. I pitied his
  consul.</p>
<p>"So we chatted on about my old playmate, until Freda, the red-cheeked
  maid, brought coffee, and the professor lighted a cigar, with a little
  bow to his daughter.</p>
<p>"'Of course, you don't smoke,' she said to me, with a glimmer of
  malice in her eyes.</p>
<p>"'He mustn't,' interposed the professor, hastily; 'it will make his
  hand tremble.'</p>
<p>"'No, it won't,' said I, laughing; 'but my hand will shake if I don't
  smoke. Are you going to employ me as a draughtsman?'</p>
<p>"'You'll know to-morrow,' he chuckled, with a mysterious smile at his
  daughter. 'Daisy, give him my best cigars—put the box here on the
  table. We can't afford to have his hand tremble.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>"Miss Holroyd rose and crossed the hallway to her father's room,
  returning presently with a box of promising-looking cigars.</p>
<p>"'I don't think he knows what is good for him,' she said. 'He should
  smoke only one every day.'</p>
<p>"It was hard to bear. I am not vindictive, but I decided to treasure
  up a few of Miss Holroyd's gentle taunts. My intimacy with her brother
  was certainly a disadvantage to me now. Jack had apparently been
  talking too much, and his sister appeared to be thoroughly acquainted
  with my past. It was a disadvantage. I remembered her vaguely as a
  girl with long braids, who used to come on Sundays with her father and
  take tea with us in our rooms. Then she went to Germany to school, and
  Jack and I employed our Sunday evenings otherwise. It is true that I
  regarded her weekly visits as a species of infliction, but I did not
  think I ever showed it.</p>
<p>"'It is strange,' said I, 'that you did not recognize me at once, Miss
  Holroyd. Have I changed so greatly in five years?'</p>
<p>"'You wore a pointed French beard in Paris,' she said—'a very downy
  one. And you never stayed to tea but twice, and then you only spoke
  once.'</p>
<p>"'Oh!' said I, blankly. 'What did I say?'</p>
<p>"'You asked me if I liked plums,' said Daisy, bursting into an
  irresistible ripple of laughter.</p>
<p>"I saw that I must have made the same sort of an ass of myself that
  most boys of eighteen do.</p>
<p>"It was too bad. I never thought about the future in those days. Who
  could have imagined that little Daisy Holroyd would have grown up into
  this <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>bewildering young lady? It was really too bad. Presently the
  professor retired to his room, carrying with him an armful of
  drawings, and bidding us not to sit up late. When he closed his door
  Miss Holroyd turned to me.</p>
<p>"'Papa will work over those drawings until midnight,' she said, with a
  despairing smile.</p>
<p>"'It isn't good for him,' I said. 'What are the drawings?'</p>
<p>"'You may know to-morrow,' she answered, leaning forward on the table
  and shading her face with one hand. 'Tell me about yourself and Jack
  in Paris.'</p>
<p>"I looked at her suspiciously.</p>
<p>"'What! There isn't much to tell. We studied. Jack went to the law
  school, and I attended—er—oh, all sorts of schools.'</p>
<p>"'Did you? Surely you gave yourself a little recreation occasionally?'</p>
<p>"'Occasionally,' I nodded.</p>
<p>"'I am afraid you and Jack studied too hard.'</p>
<p>"'That may be,' said I, looking meek.</p>
<p>"'Especially about fossils.'</p>
<p>"I couldn't stand that.</p>
<p>"'Miss Holroyd,' I said, 'I do care for fossils. You may think that I
  am a humbug, but I have a perfect mania for fossils—now.'</p>
<p>"'Since when?'</p>
<p>"'About an hour ago,' I said, airily. Out of the corner of my eye I
  saw that she had flushed up. It pleased me.</p>
<p>"'You will soon tire of the experiment,' she said, with a dangerous
  smile.</p>
<p>"'Oh, I may,' I replied, indifferently.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>"She drew back. The movement was scarcely perceptible, but I noticed
  it, and she knew I did.</p>
<p>"The atmosphere was vaguely hostile. One feels such mental conditions
  and changes instantly. I picked up a chess-board, opened it, set up
  the pieces with elaborate care, and began to move, first the white,
  then the black. Miss Holroyd watched me coldly at first, but after a
  dozen moves she became interested and leaned a shade nearer. I moved a
  black pawn forward.</p>
<p>"'Why do you do that?' said Daisy.</p>
<p>"'Because,' said I, 'the white queen threatens the pawn.'</p>
<p>"'It was an aggressive move,' she insisted.</p>
<p>"'Purely defensive,' I said. 'If her white highness will let the pawn
  alone, the pawn will let the queen alone.'</p>
<p>"Miss Holroyd rested her chin on her wrist and gazed steadily at the
  board. She was flushing furiously, but she held her ground.</p>
<p>"'If the white queen doesn't block that pawn, the pawn may become
  dangerous,' she said, coldly.</p>
<p>"I laughed, and closed up the board with a snap.</p>
<p>"'True,' I said, 'it might even take the queen.' After a moment's
  silence I asked, 'What would you do in that case, Miss Holroyd?'</p>
<p>"'I should resign,' she said, serenely; then, realizing what she had
  said, she lost her self-possession for a second, and cried: 'No,
  indeed! I should fight to the bitter end! I mean—'</p>
<p>"'What?' I asked, lingering over my revenge.</p>
<p>"'I mean,' she said, slowly, 'that your black pawn would never have
  the chance—never! I should take it immediately.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>"'I believe you would,' said I, smiling; 'so we'll call the game
  yours, and—the pawn captured.'</p>
<p>"'I don't want it,' she exclaimed. 'A pawn is worthless.'</p>
<p>"'Except when it's in the king row.'</p>
<p>"'Chess is most interesting,' she observed, sedately. She had
  completely recovered her self-possession. Still I saw that she now had
  a certain respect for my defensive powers. It was very soothing to me.</p>
<p>"'You know,' said I, gravely, 'that I am fonder of Jack than of
  anybody. That's the reason we never write each other, except to borrow
  things. I am afraid that when I was a young cub in France I was not an
  attractive personality.'</p>
<p>"'On the contrary,' said Daisy, smiling, 'I thought you were very big
  and very perfect. I had illusions. I wept often when I went home and
  remembered that you never took the trouble to speak to me but once.'</p>
<p>"'I was a cub,' I said—'not selfish and brutal, but I didn't
  understand school-girls. I never had any sisters, and I didn't know
  what to say to very young girls. If I had imagined that you felt
  hurt—'</p>
  <div id="hisFocus"></div>
<p>"'Oh, I did—five years ago. Afterwards I laughed at the whole thing.'</p>
<p>"'Laughed?' I repeated, vaguely disappointed.</p>
<p>"'Why, of course. I was very easily hurt when I was a child. I think I
  have outgrown it.'</p>
<p>"The soft curve of her sensitive mouth contradicted her.</p>
<p>"'Will you forgive me now?' I asked.</p>
<p>"'Yes. I had forgotten the whole thing until I met you an hour or so
  ago.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>"There was something that had a ring not entirely genuine in this
  speech. I noticed it, but forgot it the next moment.</p>
<p>"Presently she rose, touched her hair with the tip of one finger, and
  walked to the door.</p>
<p>"'Good-night,' she said.</p>
<p>"'Good-night,' said I, opening the door for her to pass.</p>

<p><br>
</p><p>"The sea was a sheet of silver tinged with pink. The tremendous arch
  of the sky was all shimmering and glimmering with the promise of the
  sun. Already the mist above, flecked with clustered clouds, flushed
  with rose color and dull gold. I heard the low splash of the waves
  breaking and curling across the beach. A wandering breeze, fresh and
  fragrant, blew the curtains of my window. There was the scent of sweet
  bay in the room, and everywhere the subtle, nameless perfume of the
  sea.</p>
<p>"When at last I stood upon the shore, the air and sea were all
  a-glimmer in a rosy light, deepening to crimson in the zenith. Along
  the beach I saw a little cove, shelving and all a-shine, where shallow
  waves washed with a mellow sound. Fine as dusted gold the shingle
  glowed, and the thin film of water rose, receded, crept up again a
  little higher, and again flowed back, with the low hiss of snowy foam
  and gilded bubbles breaking.</p>
<p>"I stood a little while quiet, my eyes upon the water, the invitation
  of the ocean in my ears, vague and sweet as the murmur of a shell.
  Then I looked at my bathing-suit and towels.</p>
<p>"'In we go!' said I, aloud. A second later the prophecy was
  fulfilled.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>"I swam far out to sea, and as I swam the waters all around me turned
  to gold. The sun had risen.</p>
<p>"There is a fragrance in the sea at dawn that none can name.
  Whitethorn a-bloom in May, sedges a-sway, and scented rushes rustling
  in an inland wind recall the sea to me—I can't say why.</p>
<p>"Far out at sea I raised myself, swung around, dived, and set out
  again for shore, striking strong strokes until the necked foam flew.
  And when at last I shot through the breakers, I laughed aloud and
  sprang upon the beach, breathless and happy. Then from the ocean came
  another cry, clear, joyous, and a white arm rose in the air.</p>
<p>"She came drifting in with the waves like a white sea-sprite, laughing
  at me, and I plunged into the breakers again to join her.</p>
<p>"Side by side we swam along the coast, just outside the breakers,
  until in the next cove we saw the flutter of her maid's cap-strings.</p>
<p>"'I will beat you to breakfast!' she cried, as I rested, watching her
  glide up along the beach.</p>
<p>"'Done!' said I—'for a sea-shell!'</p>
<p>"'Done!' she called, across the water.</p>
<p>"I made good speed along the shore, and I was not long in dressing,
  but when I entered the dining-room she was there, demure, smiling,
  exquisite in her cool, white frock.</p>
<p>"'The sea-shell is yours,' said I. 'I hope I can find one with a pearl
  in it.'</p>
<p>"The professor hurried in before she could reply. He greeted me very
  cordially, but there was an abstracted air about him, and he called me
  Dick until I recognized <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>that remonstrance was useless. He was not
  long over his coffee and rolls.</p>
<p>"'McPeek and Frisby will return with the last load, including your
  trunk, by early afternoon,' he said, rising and picking up his bundle
  of drawings. 'I haven't time to explain to you what we are doing,
  Dick, but Daisy will take you about and instruct you. She will give
  you the rifle standing in my room—it's a good Winchester. I have sent
  for an 'Express' for you, big enough to knock over any elephant in
  India. Daisy, take him through the sheds and tell him everything.
  Luncheon is at noon. Do you usually take luncheon, Dick?'</p>
<p>"'When I am permitted,' I smiled.</p>
<p>"'Well,' said the professor, doubtfully, 'you mustn't come back here
  for it. Freda can take you what you want. Is your hand unsteady after
  eating?'</p>
<p>"'Why, papa!' said Daisy. 'Do you intend to starve him?'</p>
<p>"We all laughed.</p>
<p>"The professor tucked his drawings into a capacious pocket, pulled his
  sea-boots up to his hips, seized a spade, and left, nodding to us as
  though he were thinking of something else.</p>
<p>"We went to the door and watched him across the salt meadows until the
  distant sand-dune hid him.</p>
<p>"'Come,' said Daisy Holroyd, 'I am going to take you to the shop.'</p>
<p>"She put on a broad-brimmed straw hat, a distractingly pretty
  combination of filmy cool stuffs, and led the way to the long, low
  structure that I had noticed the evening before.</p>
<p>"The interior was lighted by the numberless little <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>port-holes, and I
  could see everything plainly. I acknowledge I was nonplussed by what I
  did see.</p>
<p>"In the centre of the shed, which must have been at least a hundred
  feet long, stood what I thought at first was the skeleton of an
  enormous whale. After a moment's silent contemplation of the thing I
  saw that it could not be a whale, for the frames of two gigantic,
  batlike wings rose from each shoulder. Also I noticed that the animal
  possessed legs—four of them—with most unpleasant-looking webbed
  claws fully eight feet long. The bony framework of the head, too,
  resembled something between a crocodile and a monstrous
  snapping-turtle. The walls of the shanty were hung with drawings and
  blue prints. A man dressed in white linen was tinkering with the
  vertebrae of the lizard-like tail.</p>
<p>"'Where on earth did such a reptile come from?' I asked at length.</p>
<p>"'Oh, it's not real!' said Daisy, scornfully; 'it's papier-maché.'</p>
<p>"'I see,' said I; 'a stage prop.'</p>
<p>"'A what?' asked Daisy, in hurt astonishment.</p>
<p>"'Why, a—a sort of Siegfried dragon—a what's-his-name—er, Pfafner,
  or Peffer, or—'</p>
<p>"'If my father heard you say such things he would dislike you,' said
  Daisy. She looked grieved, and moved towards the door. I
  apologized—for what, I knew not—and we became reconciled. She ran
  into her father's room and brought me the rifle, a very good
  Winchester. She also gave me a cartridge-belt, full.</p>
<p>"'Now,' she smiled, 'I shall take you to your observatory, and when we
  arrive you are to begin your duty at once.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>"'And that duty?' I ventured, shouldering the rifle.</p>
<p>"'That duty is to watch the ocean. I shall then explain the whole
  affair—but you mustn't look at me while I speak; you must watch the
  sea.'</p>
<p>"'This,' said I, 'is hardship. I had rather go without the luncheon.'</p>
<p>"I do not think she was offended at my speech; still she frowned for
  almost three seconds.</p>
<p>"We passed through acres of sweet bay and spear grass, sometimes
  skirting thickets of twisted cedars, sometimes walking in the full
  glare of the morning sun, sinking into shifting sand where
  sun-scorched shells crackled under our feet, and sun-browned sea-weed
  glistened, bronzed and iridescent. Then, as we climbed a little hill,
  the sea-wind freshened in our faces, and lo! the ocean lay below us,
  far-stretching as the eye could reach, glittering, magnificent.</p>
<p>"Daisy sat down flat on the sand. It takes a clever girl to do that
  and retain the respectful deference due her from men. It takes a
  graceful girl to accomplish it triumphantly when a man is looking.</p>
<p>"'You must sit beside me,' she said—as though it would prove irksome
  to me.</p>
<p>"'Now,' she continued, 'you must watch the water while I am talking.'</p>
<p>"I nodded.</p>
<p>"'Why don't you do it, then?' she asked.</p>
<p>"I succeeded in wrenching my head towards the ocean, although I felt
  sure it would swing gradually round again in spite of me.</p>
<p>"'To begin with,' said Daisy Holroyd, 'there's a <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>thing in that ocean
  that would astonish you if you saw it. Turn your head!'</p>
<p>"'I am,' I said, meekly.</p>
<p>"'Did you hear what I said?'</p>
<p>"'Yes—er—a thing in the ocean that's going to astonish me.' Visions
  of mermaids rose before me.</p>
<p>"'The thing,' said Daisy, 'is a thermosaurus!'</p>
<p>"I nodded vaguely, as though anticipating a delightful introduction to
  a nautical friend.</p>
<p>"'You don't seem astonished,' she said, reproachfully.</p>
<p>"'Why should I be?' I asked.</p>
<p>"'Please turn your eyes towards the water. Suppose a thermosaurus
  should look out of the waves!'</p>
<p>"'Well,' said I, 'in that case the pleasure would be mutual.'</p>
<p>"She frowned and bit her upper lip.</p>
<p>"'Do you know what a thermosaurus is?' she asked.</p>
<p>"'If I am to guess,' said I, 'I guess it's a jelly-fish.'</p>
<p>"'It's that big, ugly, horrible creature that I showed you in the
  shed!' cried Daisy, impatiently.</p>
<p>"'Eh!' I stammered.</p>
<p>"'Not papier-maché, either,' she continued, excitedly; 'it's a real
  one.'</p>
<p>"This was pleasant news. I glanced instinctively at my rifle and then
  at the ocean.</p>
<p>"'Well,' said I at last, 'it strikes me that you and I resemble a pair
  of Andromedas waiting to be swallowed. This rifle won't stop a beast,
  a live beast, like that Nibelungen dragon of yours.'</p>
<p>"'Yes, it will,' she said; 'it's not an ordinary rifle.'</p>
<p>"Then, for the first time, I noticed, just below the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>magazine, a
  cylindrical attachment that was strange to me.</p>
<p>"'Now, if you will watch the sea very carefully, and will promise not
  to look at me,' said Daisy, 'I will try to explain.'</p>
<p>"She did not wait for me to promise, but went on eagerly, a sparkle of
  excitement in her blue eyes:</p>
<p>"'You know, of all the fossil remains of the great batlike and
  lizard-like creatures that inhabited the earth ages and ages ago, the
  bones of the gigantic saurians are the most interesting. I think they
  used to splash about the water and fly over the land during the
  carboniferous period; anyway, it doesn't matter. Of course you have
  seen pictures of reconstructed creatures such as the ichthyosaurus,
  the plesiosaurus, the anthracosaurus, and the thermosaurus?'</p>
<p>"I nodded, trying to keep my eyes from hers.</p>
<p>"'And you know that the remains of the thermosaurus were first
  discovered and reconstructed by papa?'</p>
<p>"'Yes,' said I. There was no use in saying no.</p>
<p>"'I am glad you do. Now, papa has proved that this creature lived
  entirely in the Gulf Stream, emerging for occasional flights across an
  ocean or two. Can you imagine how he proved it?'</p>
<p>"'No,' said I, resolutely pointing my nose at the ocean.</p>
<p>"'He proved it by a minute examination of the microscopical shells
  found among the ribs of the thermosaurus. These shells contained
  little creatures that live only in the warm waters of the Gulf Stream.
  They were the food of the thermosaurus.'</p>
<p>"'It was rather slender rations for a thing like that, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>wasn't it? Did
  he ever swallow bigger food—er—men?'</p>
<p>"'Oh yes. Tons of fossil bones from prehistoric men are also found in
  the interior of the thermosaurus.'</p>
<p>"'Then,' said I, 'you, at least, had better go back to Captain
  McPeek's—'</p>
<p>"'Please turn around; don't be so foolish. I didn't say there was a
  live thermosaurus in the water, did I?'</p>
<p>"'Isn't there?'</p>
<p>"'Why, no!'</p>
<p>"My relief was genuine, but I thought of the rifle and looked
  suspiciously out to sea.</p>
<p>"'What's the Winchester for?' I asked.</p>
<p>"'Listen, and I will explain. Papa has found out—how, I do not
  exactly understand—that there is in the waters of the Gulf Stream the
  body of a thermosaurus. The creature must have been alive within a
  year or so. The impenetrable scale-armor that covers its body has, as
  far as papa knows, prevented its disintegration. We know that it is
  there still, or was there within a few months. Papa has reports and
  sworn depositions from steamer captains and seamen from a dozen
  different vessels, all corroborating one another in essential details.
  These stories, of course, get into the newspapers—sea-serpent
  stories—but papa knows that they confirm his theory that the huge
  body of this reptile is swinging along somewhere in the Gulf Stream.'</p>
<p>"She opened her sunshade and held it over her. I noticed that she
  deigned to give me the benefit of about one-eighth of it.</p>
<p>"'Your duty with that rifle is this: if we are fortunate enough to see
  the body of the thermosaurus come <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>floating by, you are to take good
  aim and fire—fire rapidly every bullet in the magazine; then reload
  and fire again, and reload and fire as long as you have any cartridges
  left.'</p>
<p>"'A self-feeding Maxim is what I should have,' I said, with gentle
  sarcasm. 'Well, and suppose I make a sieve of this big lizard?'</p>
<p>"'Do you see these rings in the sand?' she asked.</p>
<p>"Sure enough, somebody had driven heavy piles deep into the sand all
  around us, and to the tops of these piles were attached steel rings,
  half buried under the spear-grass. We sat almost exactly in the centre
  of a circle of these rings.</p>
<p>"'The reason is this,' said Daisy; 'every bullet in your cartridges is
  steel-tipped and armor-piercing. To the base of each bullet is
  attached a thin wire of pallium. Pallium is that new metal, a thread
  of which, drawn out into finest wire, will hold a ton of iron
  suspended. Every bullet is fitted with minute coils of miles of this
  wire. When the bullet leaves the rifle it spins out this wire as a
  shot from a life-saver's mortar spins out and carries the life-line to
  a wrecked ship. The end of each coil of wire is attached to that
  cylinder under the magazine of your rifle. As soon as the shell is
  automatically ejected this wire flies out also. A bit of scarlet tape
  is fixed to the end, so that it will be easy to pick up. There is also
  a snap-clasp on the end, and this clasp fits those rings that you see
  in the sand. Now, when you begin firing, it is my duty to run and pick
  up the wire ends and attach them to the rings. Then, you see, we have
  the body of the thermosaurus full of bullets, every bullet anchored to
  the shore by tiny wires, each of which could easily hold a ton's
  strain.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>"I looked at her in amazement.</p>
<p>"'Then,' she added, calmly, 'we have captured the thermosaurus.'</p>
<p>"'Your father,' said I, at length, 'must have spent years of labor
  over this preparation.'</p>
<p>"'It is the work of a lifetime,' she said, simply.</p>
<p>"My face, I suppose, showed my misgivings.</p>
<p>"'It must not fail,' she added.</p>
<p>"'But—but we are nowhere near the Gulf Stream,' I ventured.</p>
<p>"Her face brightened, and she frankly held the sunshade over us both.</p>
<p>"'Ah, you don't know,' she said, 'what else papa has discovered. Would
  you believe that he has found a loop in the Gulf Stream—a genuine
  loop—that swings in here just outside of the breakers below? It is
  true! Everybody on Long Island knows that there is a warm current off
  the coast, but nobody imagined it was merely a sort of backwater from
  the Gulf Stream that formed a great circular mill-race around the cone
  of a subterranean volcano, and rejoined the Gulf Stream off Cape
  Albatross. But it is! That is why papa bought a yacht three years ago
  and sailed about for two years so mysteriously. Oh, I did want to go
  with him so much!'</p>
<p>"'This,' said I, 'is most astonishing.'</p>
<p>"She leaned enthusiastically towards me, her lovely face aglow.</p>
<p>"'Isn't it?' she said; 'and to think that you and papa and I are the
  only people in the whole world who know this!'</p>
<p>"To be included in such a triology was very delightful.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>"'Papa is writing the whole thing—I mean about the currents. He also
  has in preparation sixteen volumes on the thermosaurus. He said this
  morning that he was going to ask you to write the story first for some
  scientific magazine. He is certain that Professor Bruce Stoddard, of
  Columbia, will write the pamphlets necessary. This will give papa time
  to attend to the sixteen-volume work, which he expects to finish in
  three years.'</p>
<p>"'Let us first,' said I, laughing, 'catch our thermosaurus.'</p>
<p>"'We must not fail,' she said, wistfully.</p>
<p>"'We shall not fail,' I said, 'for I promise to sit on this sand-hill
  as long as I live—until a thermosaurus appears—if that is your wish,
  Miss Holroyd.'</p>
<p>"Our eyes met for an instant. She did not chide me, either, for not
  looking at the ocean. Her eyes were bluer, anyway.</p>
<p>"'I suppose,' she said, bending her head and absently pouring sand
  between her fingers—'I suppose you think me a blue-stocking, or
  something odious?'</p>
<p>"'Not exactly,' I said. There was an emphasis in my voice that made
  her color. After a moment she laid the sunshade down, still open.</p>
<p>"'May I hold it?' I asked.</p>
<p>"She nodded almost imperceptibly.</p>
<p>"The ocean had turned a deep marine blue, verging on purple, that
  heralded a scorching afternoon. The wind died away; the odor of cedar
  and sweet-bay hung heavy in the air.</p>
<p>"In the sand at our feet an iridescent flower-beetle crawled, its
  metallic green-and-blue wings burning like a spark. Great gnats, with
  filmy, glittering wings, danced <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>aimlessly above the young golden-rod;
  burnished crickets, inquisitive, timid, ran from under chips of
  driftwood, waved their antennæ at us, and ran back again. One by one
  the marbled tiger-beetles tumbled at our feet, dazed from the exertion
  of an aërial flight, then scrambled and ran a little way, or darted
  into the wire grass, where great, brilliant spiders eyed them askance
  from their gossamer hammocks.</p>
<p>"Far out at sea the white gulls floated and drifted on the water, or
  sailed up into the air to flap lazily for a moment and settle back
  among the waves. Strings of black surf-ducks passed, their strong
  wings tipping the surface of the water; single wandering coots whirled
  from the breakers into lonely flight towards the horizon.</p>
<p>"We lay and watched the little ring-necks running along the water's
  edge, now backing away from the incoming tide, now boldly wading after
  the undertow. The harmony of silence, the deep perfume, the mystery of
  waiting for that something that all await—what is it? love? death? or
  only the miracle of another morrow?—troubled me with vague
  restlessness. As sunlight casts shadows, happiness, too, throws a
  shadow, an the shadow is sadness.</p>
<p>"And so the morning wore away until Freda came with a cool-looking
  hamper. Then delicious cold fowl and lettuce sandwiches and champagne
  cup set our tongues wagging as only very young tongues can wag. Daisy
  went back with Freda after luncheon, leaving me a case of cigars, with
  a bantering smile. I dozed, half awake, keeping a partly closed eye on
  the ocean, where a faint gray streak showed plainly amid the azure
  water all around. That was the Gulf Stream loop.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>"About four o'clock Frisby appeared with a bamboo shelter-tent, for
  which I was unaffectedly grateful.</p>
<p>"After he had erected it over me he stopped to chat a bit, but the
  conversation bored me, for he could talk of nothing but bill-posting.</p>
<p>"'You wouldn't ruin the landscape here, would you?' I asked.</p>
<p>"'Ruin it!' repeated Frisby, nervously. 'It's ruined now; there ain't
  a place to stick a bill.'</p>
<p>"'The snipe stick bills—in the sand,' I said, flippantly.</p>
<p>"There was no humor about Frisby. 'Do they?' he asked.</p>
<p>"I moved with a certain impatience.</p>
<p>"'Bills,' said Frisby, 'give spice an' variety to nature. They break
  the monotony of the everlastin' green and what-you-may-call-its.'</p>
<p>"I glared at him.</p>
<p>"'Bills,' he continued, 'are not easy to stick, lemme tell you, sir.
  Sign-paintin's a soft snap when it comes to bill-stickin'. Now, I
  guess I've stuck more bills onto New York State than ennybody.'</p>
<p>"'Have you?' I said, angrily.</p>
<p>"'Yes, siree! I always pick out the purtiest spots—kinder filled
  chuck full of woods and brooks and things; then I h'ist my paste-pot
  onto a rock, and I slather that rock with gum, and whoop she goes!'</p>
<p>"'Whoop what goes?'</p>
<p>"'The bill. I paste her onto the rock, with one swipe of the brush for
  the edges and a back-handed swipe for the finish—except when a bill
  is folded in two halves.'</p>
<p>"'And what do you do then?' I asked, disgusted.</p>
<p>"'Swipe twice,' said Frisby, with enthusiasm.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>"'And you don't think it injures the landscape?'</p>
<p>"'Injures it!' he exclaimed, convinced that I was attempting to joke.</p>
<p>"I looked wearily out to sea. He also looked at the water and sighed
  sentimentally.</p>
<p>"'Floatin' buoys with bills onto 'em is a idea of mine,' he observed.
  'That damn ocean is monotonous, ain't it?'</p>
<p>"I don't know what I might have done to Frisby—the rifle was so
  convenient—if his mean yellow dog had not waddled up at this
  juncture.</p>
<p>"'Hi, Davy, sic 'em!' said Frisby, expectorating upon a clam-shell and
  hurling it seaward. The cur watched the flight of the shell
  apathetically, then squatted in the sand and looked at his master.</p>
<p>"'Kinder lost his spirit,' said Frisby, 'ain't he? I once stuck a bill
  onto Davy, an' it come off, an' the paste sorter sickened him. He was
  hell on rats—once!'</p>
<p>"After a moment or two Frisby took himself off, whistling cheerfully
  to Davy, who followed him when he was ready. The rifle burned in my
  fingers.</p>
<p>"It was nearly six o'clock when the professor appeared, spade on
  shoulder, boots smeared with mud.</p>
<p>"'Well,' he said, 'nothing to report, Dick, my boy?'</p>
<p>"'Nothing, professor.'</p>
<p>"He wiped his shining face with his handkerchief and stared at the
  water.</p>
<p>"'My calculations lead me to believe,' he said, 'that our prize may be
  due any day now. This theory I base upon the result of the report from
  the last sea-captain I saw. I cannot understand why some of these
  captains did not take the carcass in tow. They all say that they
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>tried, but that the body sank before they could come within half a
  mile. The truth is, probably, that they did not stir a foot from their
  course to examine the thing.'</p>
<p>"'Have you ever cruised about for it?' I ventured.</p>
<p>"'For two years,' he said, grimly. 'It's no use; it's accident when a
  ship falls in with it. One captain reports it a thousand miles from
  where the last skipper spoke it, and always in the Gulf Stream. They
  think it is a different specimen every time, and the papers are
  teeming with sea-serpent fol-de-rol.'</p>
<p>"'Are you sure,' I asked, 'that it will swing into the coast on this
  Gulf Stream loop?'</p>
<p>"'I think I may say that it is certain to do so. I experimented with a
  dead right-whale. You may have heard of its coming ashore here last
  summer.'</p>
<p>"'I think I did,' said I, with a faint smile. The thing had poisoned
  the air for miles around.</p>
<p>"'But,' I continued, 'suppose it comes in the night?'</p>
<p>"He laughed.</p>
<p>"'There I am lucky. Every night this month, and every day, too, the
  current of the loop runs inland so far that even a porpoise would
  strand for at least twelve hours. Longer than that I have not
  experimented with, but I know that the shore trend of the loop runs
  across a long spur of the submerged volcanic mountain, and that
  anything heavier than a porpoise would scrape the bottom and be
  carried so slowly that at least twelve hours must elapse before the
  carcass could float again into deep water. There are chances of its
  stranding indefinitely, too, but I don't care to take those chances.
  That is why I have stationed you here, Dick.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>"He glanced again at the water, smiling to himself.</p>
<p>"'There is another question I want to ask,' I said, 'if you don't
  mind.'</p>
<p>"'Of course not!' he said, warmly.</p>
<p>"'What are you digging for?'</p>
<p>"'Why, simply for exercise. The doctor told me I was killing myself
  with my sedentary habits, so I decided to dig. I don't know a better
  exercise. Do you?'</p>
<p>"'I suppose not,' I murmured, rather red in the face. I wondered
  whether he'd mention fossils.</p>
<p>"'Did Daisy tell you why we are making our papier-maché thermosaurus?'
  he asked.</p>
<p>"I shook my head.</p>
<p>"'We constructed that from measurements I took from the fossil remains
  of the thermosaurus in the Metropolitan Museum. Professor Bruce
  Stoddard made the drawings. We set it up here, all ready to receive
  the skin of the carcass that I am expecting.'</p>
<p>"We had started towards home, walking slowly across the darkening
  dunes, shoulder to shoulder. The sand was deep, and walking was not
  easy.</p>
<p>"'I wish,' said I at last, 'that I knew why Miss Holroyd asked me not
  to walk on the beach. It's much less fatiguing.'</p>
<p>"'That,' said the professor, 'is a matter that I intend to discuss
  with you to-night.' He spoke gravely, almost sadly. I felt that
  something of unparalleled importance was soon to be revealed. So I
  kept very quiet, watching the ocean out of the corners of my eyes.</p>

<p><br>
</p><p>"Dinner was ended. Daisy Holroyd lighted her father's pipe for him,
  and insisted on my smoking as much as I pleased. Then she sat down,
  and folded her hands like a good little girl, waiting for her father
  to make the revelation which I felt in my bones must be something out
  of the ordinary.</p>
<p>"The professor smoked for a while, gazing meditatively at his
  daughter; then, fixing his gray eyes on me, he said:</p>
<p>"'Have you ever heard of the kree—that Australian bird, half parrot,
  half hawk, that destroys so many sheep in New South Wales?'</p>
<p>"I nodded.</p>
<p>"'The kree kills a sheep by alighting on its back and tearing away the
  flesh with its hooked beak until a vital part is reached. You know
  that? Well, it has been discovered that the kree had prehistoric
  prototypes. These birds were enormous creatures, who preyed upon
  mammoths and mastodons, and even upon the great saurians. It has been
  conclusively proved that a few saurians have been killed by the
  ancestors of the kree, but the favorite food of these birds was
  undoubtedly the thermosaurus. It is believed that the birds attacked
  the eyes of the thermosaurus, and when, as was its habit, the mammoth
  creature turned on its <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>back to claw them, they fell upon the thinner
  scales of its stomach armor and finally killed it. This, of course, is
  a theory, but we have almost absolute proofs of its correctness. Now,
  these two birds are known among scientists as the ekaf-bird and the
  ool-yllik. The names are Australian, in which country most of their
  remains have been unearthed. They lived during the Carboniferous
  period. Now, it is not generally known, but the fact is, that in 1801
  Captain Ransom, of the British exploring vessel <i>Gull</i>, purchased from
  the natives of Tasmania the skin of an ekaf-bird that could not have
  been killed more than twenty-four hours previous to its sale. I saw
  this skin in the British Museum. It was labelled, "Unknown bird,
  probably extinct." It took me exactly a week to satisfy myself that it
  was actually the skin of an ekaf-bird. But that is not all, Dick,'
  continued the professor, excitedly. 'In 1854 Admiral Stuart, of our
  own navy, saw the carcass of a strange, gigantic bird floating along
  the southern coast of Australia. Sharks were after it, and before a
  boat could be lowered these miserable fish got it. But the good old
  admiral secured a few feathers and sent them to the Smithsonian. I saw
  them. They were not even labelled, but I knew that they were feathers
  from the ekaf-bird or its near relative, the ool-yllik.'</p>
<p>"I had grown so interested that I had leaned far across the table.
  Daisy, too, bent forward. It was only when the professor paused for a
  moment that I noticed how close together our heads were—Daisy's and
  mine. I don't think she realized it. She did not move.</p>
<p>"'Now comes the important part of this long discourse,' said the
  professor, smiling at our eagerness. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>"'Ever since the carcass of our
  derelict thermosaurus was first noticed, every captain who has seen it
  has also reported the presence of one or more gigantic birds in the
  neighborhood. These birds, at a great distance, appeared to be
  hovering over the carcass, but on the approach of a vessel they
  disappeared. Even in mid-ocean they were observed. When I heard about
  it I was puzzled. A month later I was satisfied that neither the
  ekaf-bird nor the ool-yllik was extinct. Last Monday I knew that I was
  right. I found forty-eight distinct impressions of the huge,
  seven-toed claw of the ekaf-bird on the beach here at Pine Inlet. You
  may imagine my excitement. I succeeded in digging up enough wet sand
  around one of these impressions to preserve its form. I managed to get
  it into a soap-box, and now it is there in my shop. The tide rose too
  rapidly for me to save the other footprints.'</p>
<p>"I shuddered at the possibility of a clumsy misstep on my part
  obliterating the impression of an ool-yllik.</p>
<p>"'That is the reason that my daughter warned you off the beach,' he
  said, mildly.</p>
<p>"'Hanging would have been too good for the vandal who destroyed such
  priceless prizes,' I cried out, in self-reproach.</p>
<p>"Daisy Holroyd turned a flushed face to mine and impulsively laid her
  hand on my sleeve.</p>
<p>"'How could you know?' she said.</p>
<p>"'It's all right now,' said her father, emphasizing each word with a
  gentle tap of his pipe-bowl on the table-edge; 'don't be hard on
  yourself, Dick. You'll do yeoman's service yet.'</p>
<p>"It was nearly midnight, and still we chatted on <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>about the
  thermosaurus, the ekaf-bird, and the ool-yllik, eagerly discussing the
  probability of the great reptile's carcass being in the vicinity. That
  alone seemed to explain the presence of these prehistoric birds at
  Pine Inlet.</p>
<p>"'Do they ever attack human beings?' I asked.</p>
<p>"The professor looked startled.</p>
<p>"'Gracious!' he exclaimed, 'I never thought of that. And Daisy running
  about out-of-doors! Dear me! It takes a scientist to be an unnatural
  parent!'</p>
<p>"His alarm was half real, half assumed; but, all the same, he glanced
  gravely at us both, shaking his handsome head, absorbed in thought.
  Daisy herself looked a little doubtful. As for me, my sensations were
  distinctly queer.</p>
<p>"'It is true,' said the professor, frowning at the wall, 'that human
  remains have been found associated with the bones of the ekaf-bird—I
  don't know how intimately. It is a matter to be taken into most
  serious consideration.'</p>
<p>"'The problem can be solved,' said I, 'in several ways. One is, to
  keep Miss Holroyd in the house—'</p>
<p>"'I shall not stay in,' cried Daisy, indignantly.</p>
<p>"We all laughed, and her father assured her that she should not be
  abused.</p>
<p>"'Even if I did stay in,' she said, 'one of these birds might alight
  on Master Dick.'</p>
<p>"She looked saucily at me as she spoke, but turned crimson when her
  father observed, quietly, 'You don't seem to think of me, Daisy!'</p>
<p>"'Of course I do,' she said, getting up and putting both arms around
  her father's neck; 'but Dick—as—as you call him—is so helpless and
  timid.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>"My blissful smile froze on my lips.</p>
<p>"'Timid!' I repeated.</p>
<p>"She came back to the table, making me a mocking reverence.</p>
<p>"'Do you think I am to be laughed at with impunity?' she said.</p>
<p>"'What are your other plans, Dick?' asked the professor. 'Daisy, let
  him alone, you little tease!'</p>
<p>"'One is, to haul a lot of cast-iron boilers along the dunes,' I said.
  'If these birds come when the carcass floats in, and if they seem
  disposed to trouble us, we could crawl into the boilers and be safe.'</p>
<p>"'Why, that is really brilliant!' cried Daisy.</p>
<p>"'Be quiet, my child. Dick, the plan is sound and sensible and
  perfectly practical. McPeek and Frisby shall go for a dozen loads of
  boilers to-morrow.'</p>
<p>"'It will spoil the beauty of the landscape,' said Daisy, with a
  taunting nod to me.</p>
<p>"'And Frisby will probably attempt to cover them with bill-posters,' I
  added, laughing.</p>
<p>"'That,' said Daisy, 'I shall prevent, even at the cost of his life.'
  And she stood up, looking very determined.</p>
<p>"'Children, children,' protested the professor, 'go to bed—you bother
  me.'</p>
<p>"Then I turned deliberately to Miss Holroyd.</p>
<p>"'Good-night, Daisy,' I said.</p>
<p>"'Good-night, Dick,' she said, very gently.</p>

<p><br>
</p><p>"The week passed quickly for me, leaving but few definite impressions.
  As I look back to it now I can see the long stretch of beach burning
  in the fierce sunlight, the endless meadows, with the glimmer of water
  in the distance, the dunes, the twisted cedars, the leagues of
  scintillating ocean, rocking, rocking, always rocking. In the starlit
  nights the curlew came in from the sand-bars by twos and threes; I
  could hear their querulous call as I lay in bed thinking. All day long
  the little ring-necks whistled from the shore. The plover answered
  them from distant, lonely inland pools. The great white gulls drifted
  like feathers upon the sea.</p>
<p>"One morning towards the end of the week, I, strolling along the
  dunes, came upon Frisby. He was bill-posting. I caught him red-handed.</p>
<p>"'This,' said I, 'must stop. Do you understand, Mr. Frisby?'</p>
<p>"He stepped back from his work, laying his head on one side,
  considering first me, then the bill that he had pasted on one of our
  big boilers.</p>
<p>"'Don't you like the color?' he asked. 'It goes well on them black
  boilers.'</p>
<p>"'Color! No, I don't like the color, either. Can't you understand that
  there are some people in the world <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>who object to seeing
  patent-medicine advertisements scattered over a landscape?'</p>
<p>"'Hey?' he said, perplexed.</p>
<p>"'Will you kindly remove that advertisement?' I persisted.</p>
<p>"'Too late,' said Frisby; 'it's sot.'</p>
<p>"I was too disgusted to speak, but my disgust turned to anger when I
  perceived that, as far as the eye could reach, our boilers, lying from
  three to four hundred feet apart, were ablaze with yellow-and-red
  posters extolling the 'Eureka Liver Pill Company.'</p>
<p>"'It don't cost 'em nothin',' said Frisby, cheerfully; 'I done it fur
  the fun of it. Purty, ain't it?'</p>
<p>"'They are Professor Holroyd's boilers,' I said, subduing a desire to
  beat Frisby with my telescope. 'Wait until Miss Holroyd sees this
  work.'</p>
<p>"'Don't she like yeller and red?' he demanded, anxiously.</p>
<p>"'You'll find out,' said I.</p>
<p>"Frisby gaped at his handiwork and then at his yellow dog. After a
  moment he mechanically spat on a clam-shell and requested Davy to
  'sic' it.</p>
<p>"'Can't you comprehend that you have ruined our pleasure in the
  landscape?' I asked, more mildly.</p>
<p>"'I've got some green bills,' said Frisby; 'I kin stick 'em over the
  yeller ones—'</p>
<p>"'Confound it,' said I, 'it isn't the color!'</p>
<p>"'Then,' observed Frisby, 'you don't like them pills. I've got some
  bills of the "Cropper Automobile" and a few of "Bagley, the Gents'
  Tailor"—'</p>
<p>"'Frisby,' said I, 'use them all—paste the whole collection over your
  dog and yourself—then walk off the cliff.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>"He sullenly unfolded a green poster, swabbed the boiler with paste,
  laid the upper section of the bill upon it, and plastered the whole
  bill down with a thwack of his brush. As I walked away I heard him
  muttering.</p>
<p>"Next day Daisy was so horrified that I promised to give Frisby an
  ultimatum. I found him with Freda, gazing sentimentally at his work,
  and I sent him back to the shop in a hurry, telling Freda at the same
  time that she could spend her leisure in providing Mr. Frisby with
  sand, soap, and a scrubbing-brush. Then I walked on to my post of
  observation.</p>
<p>"I watched until sunset. Daisy came with her father to hear my report,
  but there was nothing to tell, and we three walked slowly back to the
  house.</p>
<p>"In the evenings the professor worked on his volumes, the click of his
  type-writer sounding faintly behind his closed door. Daisy and I
  played chess sometimes; sometimes we played hearts. I don't remember
  that we ever finished a game of either—we talked too much.</p>
<p>"Our discussions covered every topic of interest: we argued upon
  politics; we skimmed over literature and music; we settled
  international differences; we spoke vaguely of human brotherhood. I
  say we slighted no subject of interest—I am wrong; we never spoke of
  love.</p>
<p>"Now, love is a matter of interest to ten people out of ten. Why it
  was that it did not appear to interest us is as interesting a question
  as love itself. We were young, alert, enthusiastic, inquiring. We
  eagerly absorbed theories concerning any curious phenomena in nature,
  as intellectual cocktails to stimulate discussion. And yet we did not
  discuss love. I do not say that we avoided <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>it. No; the subject was
  too completely ignored for even that. And yet we found it very
  difficult to pass an hour separated. The professor noticed this, and
  laughed at us. We were not even embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Sunday passed in pious contemplation of the ocean. Daisy read a
  little in her prayer-book, and the professor threw a cloth over his
  type-writer and strolled up and down the sands. He may have been lost
  in devout abstraction; he may have been looking for footprints. As for
  me, my mind was very serene, and I was more than happy. Daisy read to
  me a little for my soul's sake, and the professor came up and said
  something cheerful. He also examined the magazine of my Winchester.</p>
<p>"That night, too, Daisy took her guitar to the sands and sang one or
  two Basque hymns. Unlike us, the Basques do not take their pleasures
  sadly. One of their pleasures is evidently religion.</p>
<p>"The big moon came up over the dunes and stared at the sea until the
  surface of every wave trembled with radiance. A sudden stillness fell
  across the world; the wind died out; the foam ran noiselessly across
  the beach; the cricket's rune was stilled.</p>
<p>"I leaned back, dropping one hand upon the sand. It touched another
  hand, soft and cool.</p>
<p>"After a while the other hand moved slightly, and I found that my own
  had closed above it. Presently one finger stirred a little—only a
  little—for our fingers were interlocked.</p>
<p>"On the shore the foam-froth bubbled and winked and glimmered in the
  moonlight. A star fell from the zenith, showering the night with
  incandescent dust.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>"If our fingers lay interlaced beside us, her eyes were calm and
  serene as always, wide open, fixed upon the depths of a dark sky. And
  when her father rose and spoke to us, she did not withdraw her hand.</p>
<p>"'Is it late?' she asked, dreamily.</p>
<p>"'It is midnight, little daughter.'</p>
<p>"I stood up, still holding her hand, and aided her to rise. And when,
  at the door, I said good-night, she turned and looked at me for a
  little while in silence, then passed into her room slowly, with head
  still turned towards me.</p>
<p>"All night long I dreamed of her; and when the east whitened, I sprang
  up, the thunder of the ocean in my ears, the strong sea-wind blowing
  into the open window.</p>
<p>"'She's asleep,' I thought, and I leaned from the window and peered
  out into the east.</p>
<p>"The sea called to me, tossing its thousand arms; the soaring gulls,
  dipping, rising, wheeling above the sandbar, screamed and clamored for
  a playmate. I slipped into my bathing-suit, dropped from the window
  upon the soft sand, and in a moment had plunged head foremost into the
  surf, swimming beneath the waves towards the open sea.</p>
<p>"Under the tossing ocean the voice of the waters was in my ears—a
  low, sweet voice, intimate, mysterious. Through singing foam and
  broad, green, glassy depths, by whispering sandy channels atrail with
  sea-weed, and on, on, out into the vague, cool sea, I sped, rising to
  the top, sinking, gliding. Then at last I flung myself out of water,
  hands raised, and the clamor of the gulls filled my ears.</p>
<p>"As I lay, breathing fast, drifting on the sea, far out <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>beyond the
  gulls I saw a flash of white, and an arm was lifted, signalling me.</p>
<p>"'Daisy!' I called.</p>
<p>"A clear hail came across the water, distinct on the sea-wind, and at
  the same instant we raised our hands and moved towards each other.</p>
<p>"How we laughed as we met in the sea! The white dawn came up out of
  the depths, the zenith turned to rose and ashes.</p>
<p>"And with the dawn came the wind—a great sea-wind, fresh, aromatic,
  that hurled our voices back into our throats and lifted the sheeted
  spray above our heads. Every wave, crowned with mist, caught us in a
  cool embrace, cradled us, and slipped away, only to leave us to
  another wave, higher, stronger, crested with opalescent glory,
  breathing incense.</p>
<p>"We turned together up the coast, swimming lightly side by side, but
  our words were caught up by the winds and whirled into the sky.</p>
<p>"We looked up at the driving clouds; we looked out upon the pallid
  waste of waters, but it was into each other's eyes we looked,
  wondering, wistful, questioning the reason of sky and sea And there in
  each other's eyes we read the mystery, and we knew that earth and sky
  and sea were created for us alone.</p>
<p>"Drifting on by distant sands and dunes, her white fingers touching
  mine, we spoke, keying our tones to the wind's vast harmony. And we
  spoke of love.</p>
<p>"Gray and wide as the limitless span of the sky and the sea, the winds
  gathered from the world's ends to bear us on; but they were not
  familiar winds; for now, along the coast, the breakers curled and
  showed a million <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>fangs, and the ocean stirred to its depths, uneasy,
  ominous, and the menace of its murmur drew us closer as we moved.</p>
<p>"Where the dull thunder and the tossing spray warned us from sunken
  reefs, we heard the harsh challenges of gulls; where the pallid surf
  twisted in yellow coils of spume above the bar, the singing sands
  murmured of treachery and secrets of lost souls agasp in the throes of
  silent undertows.</p>
<p>"But there was a little stretch of beach glimmering through the
  mountains of water, and towards this we turned, side by side. Around
  us the water grew warmer; the breath of the following waves moistened
  our cheeks; the water itself grew gray and strange about us.</p>
<p>"'We have come too far,' I said; but she only answered:</p>
<p>"'Faster, faster! I am afraid!' The water was almost hot now; its
  aromatic odor filled our lungs.</p>
<p>"'The Gulf loop!' I muttered. 'Daisy, shall I help you?'</p>
<p>"'No. Swim—close by me! Oh-h! Dick—'</p>
<p>"Her startled cry was echoed by another—a shrill scream, unutterably
  horrible—and a great bird flapped from the beach, splashing and
  beating its pinions across the water with a thundering noise.</p>
<p>"Out across the waves it blundered, rising little by little from the
  water, and now, to my horror, I saw another monstrous bird swinging in
  the air above it, squealing as it turned on its vast wings. Before I
  could speak we touched the beach, and I half lifted her to the shore.</p>
<p>"'Quick!' I repeated. 'We must not wait.'</p>
<p>"Her eyes were dark with fear, but she rested a hand <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>on my shoulder,
  and we crept up among the dune-grasses and sank down by the point of
  sand where the rough shelter stood, surrounded by the iron-ringed
  piles.</p>
<p>"She lay there, breathing fast and deep, dripping with spray. I had no
  power of speech left, but when I rose wearily to my knees and looked
  out upon the water my blood ran cold. Above the ocean, on the breast
  of the roaring wind, three enormous birds sailed, turning and wheeling
  among one another; and below, drifting with the gray stream of the
  Gulf loop, a colossal bulk lay half submerged—a gigantic lizard,
  floating belly upward.</p>
<p>"Then Daisy crept kneeling to my side and touched me, trembling from
  head to foot.</p>
<p>"'I know,' I muttered. 'I must run back for the rifle.'</p>
<p>"'And—and leave me?'</p>
<p>"I took her by the hand, and we dragged ourselves through the
  wire-grass to the open end of a boiler lying in the sand.</p>
<p>"She crept in on her hands and knees, and called to me to follow.</p>
<p>"'You are safe now,' I cried. 'I must go back for the rifle.'</p>
<p>"'The birds may—may attack you.'</p>
<p>"'If they do I can get into one of the other boilers,' I said. 'Daisy,
  you must not venture out until I come back. You won't, will you?'</p>
<p>"'No-o,' she whispered, doubtfully.</p>
<p>"'Then—good-bye.'</p>
<p>"'Good-bye,' she answered, but her voice was very small and still.</p>
<p>"'Good-bye,' I said again. I was kneeling at the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>mouth of the big
  iron tunnel; it was dark inside and I could not see her, but, before I
  was conscious of it, her arms were around my neck and we had kissed
  each other.</p>
<p>"I don't remember how I went away. When I came to my proper senses I
  was swimming along the coast at full speed, and over my head wheeled
  one of the birds, screaming at every turn.</p>
<p>"The intoxication of that innocent embrace, the close impress of her
  arms around my neck, gave me a strength and recklessness that neither
  fear nor fatigue could subdue. The bird above me did not even frighten
  me. I watched it over my shoulder, swimming strongly, with the tide
  now aiding me, now stemming my course; but I saw the shore passing
  quickly, and my strength increased, and I shouted when I came in sight
  of the house, and scrambled up on the sand, dripping and excited.
  There was nobody in sight, and I gave a last glance up into the air
  where the bird wheeled, still screeching, and hastened into the house.
  Freda stared at me in amazement as I seized the rifle and shouted for
  the professor.</p>
<p>"'He has just gone to town, with Captain McPeek in his wagon,'
  stammered Freda.</p>
<p>"'What!' I cried. 'Does he know where his daughter is?'</p>
<p>"'Miss Holroyd is asleep—not?' gasped Freda.</p>
<p>"'Where's Frisby?' I cried, impatiently.</p>
<p>"'Yimmie?' quavered Freda.</p>
<p>"'Yes, Jimmie; isn't there anybody here? Good Heavens! where's that
  man in the shop?'</p>
<p>"'He also iss gone,' said Freda, shedding tears, 'to buy papier-maché.
  Yimmie, he iss gone to post bills.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>"I waited to hear no more, but swung my rifle over my shoulder, and,
  hanging the cartridge-belt across my chest, hurried out and up the
  beach. The bird was not in sight.</p>
<p>"I had been running for perhaps a minute when, far up on the dunes, I
  saw a yellow dog rush madly through a clump of sweet-bay, and at the
  same moment a bird soared past, rose, and hung hovering just above the
  thicket. Suddenly the bird swooped; there was a shriek and a yelp from
  the cur, but the bird gripped it in one claw and beat its wings upon
  the sand, striving to rise. Then I saw Frisby—paste, bucket, and
  brush raised—fall upon the bird, yelling lustily. The fierce creature
  relaxed its talons, and the dog rushed on, squeaking with terror. The
  bird turned on Frisby and sent him sprawling on his face, a sticky
  mass of paste and sand. But this did not end the struggle. The bird,
  croaking horridly, flew at the prostrate bill-poster, and the sand
  whirled into a pillar above its terrible wings. Scarcely knowing what
  I was about, I raised my rifle and fired twice. A scream echoed each
  shot, and the bird rose heavily in a shower of sand; but two bullets
  were embedded in that mass of foul feathers, and I saw the wires and
  scarlet tape uncoiling on the sand at my feet. In an instant I seized
  them and passed the ends around a cedar-tree, hooking the clasps
  tight. Then I cast one swift glance upward, where the bird wheeled,
  screeching, anchored like a kite to the pallium wires; and I hurried
  on across the dunes, the shells cutting my feet and the bushes tearing
  my wet swimming-suit, until I dripped with blood from shoulder to
  ankle. Out in the ocean the carcass of the thermosaurus floated, claws
  outspread, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>belly glistening in the gray light, and over him circled
  two birds. As I reached the shelter I knelt and fired into the mass of
  scales, and at my first shot a horrible thing occurred—the
  lizard-like head writhed, the slitted yellow eyes sliding open from
  the film that covered them. A shudder passed across the undulating
  body, the great scaled belly heaved, and one leg feebly clawed at the
  air.</p>
<p>"The thing was still alive!</p>
<p>"Crushing back the horror that almost paralyzed my hands, I planted
  shot after shot into the quivering reptile, while it writhed and
  clawed, striving to turn over and dive; and at each shot the black
  blood spurted in long, slim jets across the water. And now Daisy was
  at my side, pale and determined, swiftly clasping each tape-marked
  wire to the iron rings in the circle around us. Twice I filled the
  magazine from my belt, and twice I poured streams of steel-tipped
  bullets into the scaled mass, twisting and shuddering on the sea.
  Suddenly the birds steered towards us. I felt the wind from their vast
  wings. I saw the feathers erect, vibrating. I saw the spread claws
  outstretched, and I struck furiously at them, crying to Daisy to run
  into the iron shelter. Backing, swinging my clubbed rifle, I
  retreated, but I tripped across one of the taut pallium wires, and in
  an instant the hideous birds were on me, and the bone in my forearm
  snapped like a pipe-stem at a blow from their wings. Twice I struggled
  to my knees, blinded with blood, confused, almost fainting; then I
  fell again, rolling into the mouth of the iron boiler.</p>
<hr style="width: 15%; padding-top: 1.25em; padding-bottom: 1.25em;">
<p>"When I struggled back to consciousness Daisy knelt silently beside
  me, while Captain McPeek and Professor <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>Holroyd bound up my shattered
  arm, talking excitedly. The pain made me faint and dizzy. I tried to
  speak and could not. At last they got me to my feet and into the
  wagon, and Daisy came, too, and crouched beside me, wrapped in
  oilskins to her eyes. Fatigue, lack of food, and excitement had
  combined with wounds and broken bones to extinguish the last atom of
  strength in my body; but my mind was clear enough to understand that
  the trouble was over and the thermosaurus safe.</p>
<p>"I heard McPeek say that one of the birds that I had anchored to a
  cedar-tree had torn loose from the bullets and had winged its way
  heavily out to sea. The professor answered: 'Yes, the ekaf-bird; the
  others were ool-ylliks. I'd have given my right arm to have secured
  them.' Then for a time I heard no more; but the jolting of the wagon
  over the dunes roused me to keenest pain, and I held out my right hand
  to Daisy. She clasped it in both of hers, and kissed it again and
  again.</p>
<hr style="width: 15%; padding-top: 1.25em; padding-bottom: 1.25em;">
<p>"There is little more to add, I think. Professor Bruce Stoddard's
  scientific pamphlet will be published soon, to be followed by
  Professor Holroyd's sixteen volumes. In a few days the stuffed and
  mounted thermosaurus will be placed on free public exhibition in the
  arena of Madison Square Garden, the only building in the city large
  enough to contain the body of this immense winged reptile."</p>
<hr style="width: 15%; padding-top: 1.25em; padding-bottom: 1.25em;">
<p>The young man hesitated, looking long and earnestly at Miss Barrison.</p>
<p>"Did you marry her?" she asked, softly.</p>
<p>"You wouldn't believe it," said the young man, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>earnestly—"you
  wouldn't believe it, after all that happened, if I should tell you
  that she married Professor Bruce Stoddard, of Columbia—would you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I would," said Miss Barrison. "You never can tell what a girl
  will do."</p>
<p>"That story of yours," I said, "is to me the most wonderful and
  valuable contribution to nature study that it has ever been my fortune
  to listen to. You are fitted to write; it is your sacred mission to
  produce. Are you going to?"</p>
<p>"I am writing," said the young man, quietly, "a nature book. Sir Peter
  Grebe's magnificent monograph on the speckled titmouse inspired me.
  But nature study is not what I have chosen as my life's mission."</p>
<p>He looked dreamily across at Miss Barrison. "No, not natural
  phenomena," he repeated, "but unnatural phenomena. What Professor
  Hyssop has done for Columbia, I shall attempt to do for Harvard. In
  fact, I have already accepted the chair of Psychical Phenomena at
  Cambridge."</p>
<p>I gazed upon him with intense respect.</p>
<p>"A personal experience revealed to me my life's work," he, went on,
  thoughtfully stroking his blond mustache. "If Miss Barrison would care
  to hear it—"</p>
<p>"Please tell it," she said, sweetly.</p>
<p>"I shall have to relate it clothed in that artificial garb known as
  literary style," he explained, deprecatingly.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter," I said, "I never noticed any style at all in your
  story of the thermosaurus."</p>
<p>He smiled gratefully, and passed his hand over his face; a far-away
  expression came into his eyes, and he slowly began, hesitating, as
  though talking to himself:</p>

</p><h3>XXII<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc" class="pginternal">ToC</a></span></h3>
<p><br>
</p><p>"It was high noon in the city of Antwerp. From slender steeples
  floated the mellow music of the Flemish bells, and in the spire of the
  great cathedral across the square the cracked chimes clashed discords
  until my ears ached.</p>
<p>"When the fiend in the cathedral had jerked the last tuneless clang
  from the chimes, I removed my fingers from my ears and sat down at one
  of the iron tables in the court. A waiter, with his face shaved blue,
  brought me a bottle of Rhine wine, a tumbler of cracked ice, and a
  siphon.</p>
<p>"'Does monsieur desire anything else?' he inquired.</p>
<p>"'Yes—the head of the cathedral bell-ringer; bring it with vinegar
  and potatoes,' I said, bitterly. Then I began to ponder on my
  great-aunt and the Crimson Diamond.</p>
<p>"The white walls of the Hôtel St. Antoine rose in a rectangle around
  the sunny court, casting long shadows across the basin of the
  fountain. The strip of blue overhead was cloudless. Sparrows twittered
  under the eaves the yellow awnings fluttered, the flowers swayed in
  the summer breeze, and the jet of the fountain splashed among the
  water-plants. On the sunny side of the piazza the tables were vacant;
  on the shady side I was lazily aware that the tables behind me were
  occupied, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>but I was indifferent as to their occupants, partly because
  I shunned all tourists, partly because I was thinking of my
  great-aunt.</p>
<p>"Most old ladies are eccentric, but there is a limit, and my
  great-aunt had overstepped it. I had believed her to be wealthy—she
  died bankrupt. Still, I knew there was one thing she did possess, and
  that was the famous Crimson Diamond. Now, of course, you know who my
  great-aunt was.</p>
<p>"Excepting the Koh-i-noor and the Regent, this enormous and unique
  stone was, as everybody knows, the most valuable gem in existence. Any
  ordinary person would have placed that diamond in a safe-deposit. My
  great-aunt did nothing of the kind. She kept it in a small velvet bag,
  which she carried about her neck. She never took it off, but wore it
  dangling openly on her heavy silk gown.</p>
<p>"In this same bag she also carried dried catnip-leaves, of which she
  was inordinately fond. Nobody but myself, her only living relative,
  knew that the Crimson Diamond lay among the sprigs of catnip in the
  little velvet bag.</p>
<p>"'Harold,' she would say, 'do you think I'm a fool? If I place the
  Crimson Diamond in any safe-deposit vault in New York, somebody will
  steal it, sooner or later.' Then she would nibble a sprig of catnip
  and peer cunningly at me. I loathed the odor of catnip and she knew
  it. I also loathed cats. This also she knew, and of course surrounded
  herself with a dozen. Poor old lady! One day she was found dead in her
  bed in her apartments at the Waldorf. The doctor said she died from
  natural causes. The only other occupant of her sleeping-room was a
  cat. The cat fled when we broke <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>open the door, and I heard that she
  was received and cherished by some eccentric people in a neighboring
  apartment.</p>
<p>"Now, although my great-aunt's death was due to purely natural causes,
  there was one very startling and disagreeable feature of the case. The
  velvet bag containing the Crimson Diamond had disappeared. Every inch
  of the apartment was searched, the floors torn up, the walls
  dismantled, but the Crimson Diamond had vanished. Chief of Police
  Conlon detailed four of his best men on the case, and, as I had
  nothing better to do, I enrolled myself as a volunteer. I also offered
  $25,000 reward for the recovery of the gem. All New York was agog.</p>
<p>"The case seemed hopeless enough, although there were five of us after
  the thief. McFarlane was in London, and had been for a month, but
  Scotland Yard could give him no help, and the last I heard of him he
  was roaming through Surrey after a man with a white spot in his hair.
  Harrison had gone to Paris. He kept writing me that clews were plenty
  and the scent hot, but as Dennet, in Berlin, and Clancy, in Vienna,
  wrote me the same thing, I began to doubt these gentlemen's ability.</p>
<p>"'You say,' I answered Harrison, 'that the fellow is a Frenchman, and
  that he is now concealed in Paris; but Dennet writes me by the same
  mail that the thief is undoubtedly a German, and was seen yesterday in
  Berlin. To-day I received a letter from Clancy, assuring me that
  Vienna holds the culprit, and that he is an Austrian from Trieste.
  Now, for Heaven's sake,' I ended, 'let me alone and stop writing me
  letters until you have something to write about.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>"The night-clerk at the Waldorf had furnished us with our first clew.
  On the night of my aunt's death he had seen a tall, grave-faced man
  hurriedly leave the hotel. As the man passed the desk he removed his
  hat and mopped his forehead, and the night-clerk noticed that in the
  middle of his head there was a patch of hair as white as snow.</p>
<p>"We worked this clew for all it was worth, and, a month later, I
  received a cable despatch from Paris, saying that a man answering to
  the description of the Waldorf suspect had offered an enormous crimson
  diamond for sale to a jeweller in the Palais Royal. Unfortunately the
  fellow took fright and disappeared before the jeweller could send for
  the police, and since that time McFarlane in London, Harrison in
  Paris, Dennet in Berlin, and Clancy in Vienna had been chasing men
  with white patches on their hair until no gray-headed patriarch in
  Europe was free from suspicion. I myself had sleuthed it through
  England, France, Holland, and Belgium, and now I found myself in
  Antwerp at the Hôtel St. Antoine, without a clew that promised
  anything except another outrage on some respectable white-haired
  citizen. The case seemed hopeless enough, unless the thief tried again
  to sell the gem. Here was our only hope, for, unless he cut the stone
  into smaller ones, he had no more chance of selling it than he would
  have had if he had stolen the Venus of Milo and peddled her about the
  Rue de Seine. Even were he to cut up the stone, no respectable gem
  collector or jeweller would buy a crimson diamond without first
  notifying me; for although a few red stones are known to collectors,
  the color of the Crimson Diamond was absolutely unique, and there was
  little probability of an honest mistake.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>"Thinking of all these things, I sat sipping my Rhine wine in the
  shadow of the yellow awnings. A large white cat came sauntering by and
  stopped in front of me to perform her toilet, until I wished she would
  go away. After a while she sat up, licked her whiskers, yawned once or
  twice, and was about to stroll on, when, catching sight of me, she
  stopped short and looked me squarely in the face. I returned the
  attention with a scowl, because I wished to discourage any advances
  towards social intercourse which she might contemplate; but after a
  while her steady gaze disconcerted me, and I turned to my Rhine wine.
  A few minutes later I looked up again. The cat was still eying me.</p>
<p>"'Now what the devil is the matter with the animal,' I muttered; 'does
  she recognize in me a relative?'</p>
<p>"'Perhaps,' observed a man at the next table.</p>
<p>"'What do you mean by that?' I demanded.</p>
<p>"'What I say,' replied the man at the next table.</p>
<p>"I looked him full in the face. He was old and bald and appeared
  weak-minded. His age protected his impudence. I turned my back on him.
  Then my eyes fell on the cat again. She was still gazing earnestly at
  me.</p>
<p>"Disgusted that she should take such pointed public notice of me, I
  wondered whether other people saw it; I wondered whether there was
  anything peculiar in my own personal appearance. How hard the creature
  stared! It was most embarrassing.</p>
<p>"'What has got into that cat?' I thought. 'It's sheer impudence. It's
  an intrusion, and I won't stand it!' The cat did not move. I tried to
  stare her out of countenance. It was useless. There was aggressive
  inquiry <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>in her yellow eyes. A sensation of uneasiness began to steal
  over me—a sensation of embarrassment not unmixed with awe. All cats
  looked alike to me, and yet there was something about this one that
  bothered me—something that I could not explain to myself, but which
  began to occupy me.</p>
<p>"She looked familiar—this Antwerp cat. An odd sense of having seen
  her before, of having been well acquainted with her in former years,
  slowly settled in my mind, and, although I could never remember the
  time when I had not detested cats, I was almost convinced that my
  relations with this Antwerp tabby had once been intimate if not
  cordial. I looked more closely at the animal. Then an idea struck
  me—an idea which persisted and took definite shape in spite of me. I
  strove to escape from it, to evade it, to stifle and smother it; an
  inward struggle ensued which brought the perspiration in beads upon my
  cheeks—a struggle short, sharp, decisive. It was useless—useless to
  try to put it from me—this idea so wretchedly bizarre, so grotesque
  and fantastic, so utterly inane—it was useless to deny that the cat
  bore a distinct resemblance to my great-aunt!</p>
<p>"I gazed at her in horror. What enormous eyes the creature had!</p>
<p>"'Blood is thicker than water,' said the man at the next table.</p>
<p>"'What does he mean by that?' I muttered, angrily, swallowing a
  tumbler of Rhine wine and seltzer. But I did not turn. What was the
  use?</p>
<p>"'Chattering old imbecile,' I added to myself, and struck a match, for
  my cigar was out; but, as I raised the match to relight it, I
  encountered the cat's eyes again. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>I could not enjoy my cigar with the
  animal staring at me, but I was justly indignant, and I did not intend
  to be routed. 'The idea! Forced to leave for a cat!' I sneered. 'We
  will see who will be the one to go!' I tried to give her a jet of
  seltzer from the siphon, but the bottle was too nearly empty to carry
  far. Then I attempted to lure her nearer, calling her in French,
  German, and English, but she did not stir. I did not know the Flemish
  for 'cat.'</p>
<p>"'She's got a name, and won't come,' I thought. 'Now, what under the
  sun can I call her?'</p>
<p>"'Aunty,' suggested the man at the next table.</p>
<p>"I sat perfectly still. Could that man have answered my thoughts?—for
  I had not spoken aloud. Of course not—it was a coincidence—but a
  very disgusting one.</p>
<p>"'Aunty,' I repeated, mechanically, 'aunty, aunty—good gracious, how
  horribly human that cat looks!' Then, somehow or other, Shakespeare's
  words crept into my head and I found myself repeating: 'The soul of my
  grandam might haply inhabit a bird; the soul of—nonsense!' I
  growled—'it isn't printed correctly! One might possibly say, speaking
  in poetical metaphor, that the soul of a bird might haply inhabit
  one's grandam—' I stopped short, flushing painfully. 'What awful
  rot!' I murmured, and lighted another cigar. The cat was still
  staring; the cigar went out. I grew more and more nervous. 'What rot!'
  I repeated. 'Pythagoras must have been an ass, but I do believe there
  are plenty of asses alive to-day who swallow that sort of thing.'</p>
<p>"'Who knows?' sighed the man at the next table, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>I sprang to my
  feet and wheeled about. But I only caught a glimpse of a pair of
  frayed coat-tails and a bald head vanishing into the dining-room. I
  sat down again, thoroughly indignant. A moment later the cat got up
  and went away.</p>

<p><br>
</p><p>"Daylight was fading in the city of Antwerp. Down into the sea sank
  the sun, tinting the vast horizon with flakes of crimson, and touching
  with rich deep undertones the tossing waters of the Scheldt. Its glow
  fell like a rosy mantle over red-tiled roofs and meadows; and through
  the haze the spires of twenty churches pierced the air like sharp,
  gilded flames. To the west and south the green plains, over which the
  Spanish armies tramped so long ago, stretched away until they met the
  sky; the enchantment of the after-glow had turned old Antwerp into
  fairy-land; and sea and sky and plain were beautiful and vague as the
  night-mists floating in the moats below.</p>
<p>"Along the sea-wall from the Rubens Gate all Antwerp strolled, and
  chattered, and flirted, and sipped their Flemish wines from slender
  Flemish glasses, or gossiped over krugs of foaming beer.</p>
<p>"From the Scheldt came the cries of sailors, the creaking of cordage,
  and the puff! puff! of the ferry-boats. On the bastions of the
  fortress opposite, a bugler was standing. Twice the mellow notes of
  the bugle came faintly over the water, then a great gun thundered from
  the ramparts, and the Belgian flag fluttered along the lanyards to the
  ground.</p>
<p>"I leaned listlessly on the sea-wall and looked down <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>at the Scheldt
  below. A battery of artillery was embarking for the fortress. The
  tublike transport lay hissing and whistling in the slip, and the
  stamping of horses, the rumbling of gun and caisson, and the sharp
  cries of the officers came plainly to the ear.</p>
<p>"When the last caisson was aboard and stowed, and the last trooper had
  sprung jingling to the deck, the transport puffed out into the
  Scheldt, and I turned away through the throng of promenaders; and
  found a little table on the terrace, just outside of the pretty café.
  And as I sat down I became aware of a girl at the next table—a girl
  all in white—the most ravishingly and distractingly pretty girl that
  I had ever seen. In the agitation of the moment I forgot my name, my
  fortune, my aunt, and the Crimson Diamond—all these I forgot in a
  purely human impulse to see clearly; and to that end I removed my
  monocle from my left eye. Some moments later I came to myself and
  feebly replaced it. It was too late; the mischief was done. I was not
  aware at first of the exact state of my feelings—for I had never been
  in love more than three or four times in all my life—but I did know
  that at her request I would have been proud to stand on my head, or
  turn a flip-flap into the Scheldt.</p>
<p>"I did not stare at her, but I managed to see her most of the time
  when her eyes were in another direction. I found myself drinking
  something which a waiter brought, presumably upon an order which I did
  not remember having given. Later I noticed that it was a loathsome
  drink which the Belgians call 'American grog,' but I swallowed it and
  lighted a cigarette. As the fragrant cloud rose in the air, a voice,
  which I recognized with a <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>chill, broke, into my dream of enchantment.
  Could <i>he</i> have been there all the while—there sitting beside that
  vision in white? His hat was off, and the ocean-breezes whispered
  about his bald head. His frayed coat-tails were folded carefully over
  his knees, and between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand he
  balanced a bad cigar. He looked at me in a mildly cheerful way, and
  said, 'I know now.'</p>
<p>"'Know what?' I asked, thinking it better to humor him, for I was
  convinced that he was mad.</p>
<p>"'I know why cats bite.'</p>
<p>"This was startling. I hadn't an idea what to say.</p>
<p>"'I know why,' he repeated; 'can you guess why?' There was a covert
  tone of triumph in his voice and he smiled encouragement. 'Come, try
  and guess,' he urged.</p>
<p>"I told him that I was unequal to problems.</p>
<p>"'Listen, young man,' he continued, folding his coat-tails closely
  about his legs—'try to reason it out: why should cats bite? Don't you
  know? I do.'</p>
<p>"He looked at me anxiously.</p>
<p>"'You take no interest in this problem?' he demanded.</p>
<p>"'Oh yes.'</p>
<p>"'Then why do you not ask me why?' he said, looking vaguely
  disappointed.</p>
<p>"'Well,' I said, in desperation, 'why do cats bite?—hang it all!' I
  thought, 'it's like a burned-cork show, and I'm Mr. Bones and he's
  Tambo!'</p>
<p>"Then he smiled gently. 'Young man,' he said, 'cats bite because they
  feed on catnip. I have reasoned it out.'</p>
<p>"I stared at him in blank astonishment. Was this <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>benevolent-looking
  old party poking fun at me? Was he paying me up for the morning's
  snub? Was he a malignant and revengeful old party, or was he merely
  feeble-minded? Who might he be? What was he doing here in
  Antwerp—what was he doing now?—for the bald one had turned
  familiarly to the beautiful girl in white.</p>
<p>"'Wilhelmina,' he said, 'do you feel chilly?' The girl shook her head.</p>
<p>"'Not in the least, papa.'</p>
<p>"'Her father!' I thought—'her father!' Thank God she did not say
  'popper'!</p>
<p>"'I have been to the Zoo to-day,' announced the bald one, turning
  towards me.</p>
<p>"'Ah, indeed,' I observed; 'er—I trust you enjoyed it.'</p>
<p>"'I have been contemplating the apes,' he continued, dreamily. 'Yes,
  contemplating the apes.'</p>
<p>"I tried to look interested.</p>
<p>"'Yes, the apes,' he murmured, fixing his mild eyes on me. Then he
  leaned towards me confidentially and whispered, 'Can you tell me what
  a monkey thinks?'</p>
<p>"'I cannot,' I replied, sharply.</p>
<p>"'Ah,' he sighed, sinking back in his chair, and patting the slender
  hand of the girl beside him—'ah, who can tell what a monkey thinks?'
  His gentle face lulled my suspicions, and I replied, very gravely:</p>
<p>"'Who can tell whether they think at all?'</p>
<p>"'True, true! Who can tell whether they think at all; and if they do
  think, ah! who can tell what they think?'</p>
<p>"'But,' I began, 'if you can't tell whether they think <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>at all, what's
  the use of trying to conjecture what they <i>would</i> think if they <i>did</i>
  think?'</p>
<p>"He raised his hand in deprecation. 'Ah, it is exactly that which is
  of such absorbing interest—exactly that! It is the abstruseness of
  the proposition which stimulates research—which stirs profoundly the
  brain of the thinking world. The question is of vital and instant
  importance. Possibly you have already formed an opinion.'</p>
<p>"I admitted that I had thought but little on the subject.</p>
<p>"'I doubt,' he continued, swathing his knees in his coat-tails—'I
  doubt whether you have given much attention to the subject lately
  discussed by the Boston Dodo Society of Pythagorean Research.'</p>
<p>"'I am not sure,' I said, politely, 'that I recall that particular
  discussion. May I ask what was the question brought up?'</p>
<p>"'The Felis domestica question.'</p>
<p>"'Ah, that must indeed be interesting! And—er—what may be the Felis
  do—do—'</p>
<p>"'Domestica—not dodo. Felis domestica, the common or garden cat.'</p>
<p>"'Indeed,' I murmured.</p>
<p>"'You are not listening,' he said.</p>
<p>"I only half heard him. I could not turn my eyes from his daughter's
  face.</p>
<p>"'Cat!' shouted the bald one, and I almost leaped from my chair. 'Are
  you deaf?' he inquired, sympathetically.</p>
<p>"'No—oh no!' I replied, coloring with confusion; 'you were—pardon
  me—you were—er—speaking of the dodo. Extraordinary bird that—'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>"'I was not discussing the dodo,' he sighed. 'I was speaking of cats.'</p>
<p>"'Of course,' I said.</p>
<p>"'The question is,' he continued, twisting his frayed coat-tails into
  a sort of rope—'the question is, how are we to ameliorate the present
  condition and social status of our domestic cats?'</p>
<p>"'Feed 'em,' I suggested.</p>
<p>"He raised both hands. They were eloquent with patient expostulation.
  'I mean their spiritual condition,' he said.</p>
<p>"I nodded, but my eyes reverted to that exquisite face. She sat
  silent, her eyes fixed on the waning flecks of color in the western
  sky.</p>
<p>"'Yes,' repeated the bald one, 'the spiritual welfare of our domestic
  cats.'</p>
<p>"'Toms and tabbies?' I murmured.</p>
<p>"'Exactly,' he said, tying a large knot in his coat-tails.</p>
<p>"'You will ruin your coat,' I observed.</p>
<p>"'Papa!' exclaimed the girl, turning in dismay, as that gentleman gave
  a guilty start, 'stop it at once!'</p>
<p>"He smiled apologetically and made a feeble attempt to conceal his
  coat-tails.</p>
<p>"'My dear,' he said, with gentle deprecation, 'I am so
  absent-minded—I always do it in the heat of argument.'</p>
<p>"The girl rose, and, bending over her untidy parent, deftly untied the
  knot in his flapping coat. When he was disentangled, she sat down and
  said, with a ghost of a smile, 'He is so very absent-minded.'</p>
<p>"'Your father is evidently a great student,' I ventured, pleasantly.
  How I pitied her, tied to this old lunatic!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>"'Yes, he is a great student,' she said, quietly.</p>
<p>"'I am,' he murmured; 'that's what makes me so absent-minded. I often
  go to bed and forget to sleep.' Then, looking at me, he asked me my
  name, adding, with a bow, that his name was P. Royal Wyeth, Professor
  of Pythagorean Research and Abstruse Paradox.</p>
<p>"'My first name is Penny—named after Professor Penny, of Harvard,' he
  said; 'but I seldom use my first name in connection with my second, as
  the combination suggests a household remedy of penetrating odor.'</p>
<p>"'My name is Kensett,' I said, 'Harold Kensett, of New York.'</p>
<p>"'Student?'</p>
<p>"'Er—a little.'</p>
<p>"'Student of diamonds?'</p>
<p>"I smiled. 'Oh, I see you know who my great-aunt was,' I said.</p>
<p>"'I know her,' he said.</p>
<p>"'Ah—perhaps you are unaware that my great-aunt is not now living.'</p>
<p>"'I know her,' he repeated, obstinately.</p>
<p>"I bowed. What a crank he was!</p>
<p>"'What do you study? You don't fiddle away all your time, do you?' he
  asked.</p>
<p>"Now that was just what I did, but I was not pleased to have Miss
  Wyeth know it. Although my time was chiefly spent in killing time, I
  had once, in a fit of energy, succeeded in writing some verses 'To a
  Tomtit,' so I evaded a humiliating confession by saying that I had
  done a little work in ornithology.</p>
<p>"'Good!' cried the professor, beaming all over. 'I knew you were a
  fellow-scientist. Possibly you are a <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>brother-member of the Boston
  Dodo Society of Pythagorean Research. Are you a dodo?'</p>
<p>"I shook my head. 'No, I am not a dodo.'</p>
<p>"'Only a jay?'</p>
<p>"'A—what?' I said, angrily.</p>
<p>"'A jay. We call the members of the Junior Ornithological Jay Society
  of New York, jays, just as we refer to ourselves as dodos. Are you not
  even a jay?'</p>
<p>"'I am not,' I said, watching him suspiciously.</p>
<p>"'I must convert you, I see,' said the professor, smiling.</p>
<p>"'I'm afraid I do not approve of Pythagorean research,' I began, but
  the beautiful Miss Wyeth turned to me very seriously, and, looking me
  frankly in the eyes, said:</p>
<p>"'I trust you will be open to conviction.'</p>
<p>"'Good Lord!' I thought. 'Can she be another lunatic?' I looked at her
  steadily. What a little beauty she was! She also, then, belonged to
  the Pythagoreans—a sect I despised. Everybody knows all about the
  Pythagorean craze, its rise in Boston, its rapid spread, and its
  subsequent consolidation with mental and Christian science, theosophy,
  hypnotism, the Salvation Army, the Shakers, the Dunkards, and the
  mind-cure cult, upon a business basis. I had hitherto regarded all
  Pythagoreans with the same scornful indifference which I accorded to
  the faith-curists; being a member of no particular church, I was
  scarcely prepared to take any of them seriously. Least of all did I
  approve of the 'business basis,' and I looked very much askance indeed
  at the 'Scientific and Religious Trust Company,' duly incorporated and
  generally known as the Pythagorean <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>Trust, which, consolidating with
  mind-curists, faith-curists, and other flourishing salvation
  syndicates, actually claimed a place among ordinary trusts, and at the
  same time pretended to a control over man's future life. No, I could
  never listen—I was ashamed of even entertaining the notion, and I
  shook my head.</p>
<p>"'No, Miss Wyeth, I am afraid I do not care to listen to any reasoning
  on this subject.'</p>
<p>"'Don't you believe in Pythagoras?' demanded the professor, subduing
  his excitement with difficulty, and adding another knot to his
  coat-tails.</p>
<p>"'No,' I said, 'I do not.'</p>
<p>"'How do you know you don't?' inquired the professor.</p>
<p>"'Because,' I said, firmly, 'it is nonsense to say that the soul of a
  human being can inhabit a hen!'</p>
<p>"'Put it in a more simplified form!' insisted the professor. 'Do you
  believe that the soul of a hen can inhabit a human being?'</p>
<p>"'No, I don't!'</p>
<p>"'Did you ever hear of a hen-pecked man?' cried the professor, his
  voice ending in a shout.</p>
<p>"I nodded, intensely annoyed.</p>
<p>"'Will you listen to reason, then?' he continued, eagerly.</p>
<p>"'No,' I began, but I caught Miss Wyeth's blue eyes fixed on mine with
  an expression so sad, so sweetly appealing, that I faltered.</p>
<p>"'Yes, I will listen,' I said, faintly.</p>
<p>"'Will you become my pupil?' insisted the professor.</p>
<p>"I was shocked to find myself wavering, but my eyes were looking into
  hers, and I could not disobey what I <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>read there. The longer I looked
  the greater inclination I felt to waver. I saw that I was going to
  give in, and, strangest of all, my conscience did not trouble me. I
  felt it coming—a sort of mild exhilaration took possession of me. For
  the first time in my life I became reckless—I even gloried in my
  recklessness.</p>
<p>"'Yes, yes,' I cried, leaning eagerly across the table, 'I shall be
  glad—delighted! Will you take me as your pupil?' My single eye-glass
  fell from its position unheeded. 'Take me! Oh, will you take me?' I
  cried. Instead of answering, the professor blinked rapidly at me for a
  moment. I imagined his eyes had grown bigger, and were assuming a
  greenish tinge. The corners of his mouth began to quiver, emitting
  queer, caressing little noises, and he rapidly added knot after knot
  to his twitching coat-tails. Suddenly he bent forward across the table
  until his nose almost touched mine. The pupils of his eyes expanded,
  the iris assuming a beautiful, changing, golden-green tinge, and his
  coat-tails switched violently. Then he began to mew.</p>
<p>"I strove to rouse myself from my paralysis—I tried to shrink back,
  for I felt the end of his cold nose touch mine. I could not move. The
  cry of terror died in my straining throat, my hands tightened
  convulsively; I was incapable of speech or motion. At the same time my
  brain became wonderfully clear. I began to remember everything that
  had ever happened to me—everything that I had ever done or said. I
  even remembered things that I had neither done nor said; I recalled
  distinctly much that had never happened. How fresh and strong my
  memory! The past was like a mirror, crystal clear, and there, in
  glorious tints and hues, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>the scenes of my childhood grew and glowed
  and faded, and gave place to newer and more splendid scenes. For a
  moment the episode of the cat at the Hôtel St. Antoine flashed across
  my mind. When it vanished a chilly stupor slowly clouded my brain; the
  scenes, the memories, the brilliant colors, faded, leaving me
  enveloped in a gray vapor, through which the two great eyes of the
  professor twinkled with a murky light. A peculiar longing stirred
  me—a strange yearning for something, I knew not what—but, oh! how I
  longed and yearned for it! Slowly this indefinite, incomprehensible
  longing became a living pain. Ah, how I suffered, and how the vapors
  seemed to crowd around me! Then, as at a great distance, I heard her
  voice, sweet, imperative:</p>
<p>"'Mew!' she said.</p>
<p>"For a moment I seemed to see the interior of my own skull, lighted as
  by a flash of fire; the rolling eyeballs, veined in scarlet, the
  glistening muscles quivering along the jaw, the humid masses of the
  convoluted brain; then awful darkness—a darkness almost tangible—an
  utter blackness, through which now seemed to creep a thin, silver
  thread, like a river crawling across a world—like a thought gliding
  to the brain—like a song, a thin, sharp song which some distant voice
  was singing—which I was singing.</p>
<p>"And I knew that I was mewing!</p>
<p>"I threw myself back in my chair and mewed with all my heart. Oh, that
  heavy load which was lifted from my breast! How good, how satisfying
  it was to mew! And how I did miaul and yowl!</p>
<p>"I gave myself up to it, heart and soul; my whole <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>being thrilled with
  the passionate outpourings of a spirit freed. My voice trembled in the
  upper bars of a feline love-song, quavered, descended, swelling again
  into an intimation that I brooked no rival, and ended with a
  magnificent crescendo.</p>
<p>"I finished, somewhat abashed, and glanced askance at the professor
  and his daughter, but the one sat nonchalantly disentangling his
  coat-tails, and the other was apparently absorbed in the distant
  landscape. Evidently they did not consider me ridiculous. Flushing
  painfully, I turned in my chair to see how my grewsome solo had
  affected the people on the terrace. Nobody even looked at me. This,
  however, gave me little comfort, for, as I began to realize what I had
  done, my mortification and rage knew no bounds. I was ready to die of
  shame. What on earth had induced me to mew? I looked wildly about for
  escape—I would leap up—rush home to bury my burning face in my
  pillows, and, later, in the friendly cabin of a homeward-bound
  steamer. I would fly—fly at once! Woe to the man who blocked my way!
  I started to my feet, but at that moment I caught Miss Wyeth's eyes
  fixed on mine.</p>
<p>"'Don't go,' she said.</p>
<p>"What in Heaven's name lay in those blue eyes? I slowly sank back into
  my chair.</p>
<p>"Then the professor spoke: 'Wilhelmina, I have just received a
  despatch.'</p>
<p>"'Where from, papa?'</p>
<p>"'From India. I'm going at once.'</p>
<p>"She nodded her head, without turning her eyes from the sea. 'Is it
  important, papa?'</p>
<p>"'I should say so. The cashier of the local trust has <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>compromised an
  astral body, and has squandered on her all our funds, including a lot
  of first mortgages on Nirvana. I suppose he's been dabbling in futures
  and is short in his accounts. I sha'n't be gone long.'</p>
<p>"'Then, good-night, papa,' she said, kissing him; 'try to be back by
  eleven.' I sat stupidly staring at them.</p>
<p>"'Oh, it's only to Bombay—I sha'n't go to Thibet
  to-night—good-night, my dear,' said the professor.</p>
<p>"Then a singular thing occurred. The professor had at last succeeded
  in disentangling his coat-tails, and now, jamming his hat over his
  ears, and waving his arms with a batlike motion, he climbed upon the
  seat of his chair and ejaculated the word 'Presto!' Then I found my
  voice.</p>
<p>"'Stop him!' I cried, in terror.</p>
<p>"'Presto! Presto!' shouted the professor, balancing himself on the
  edge of his chair and waving his arms majestically, as if preparing
  for a sudden flight across the Scheldt; and, firmly convinced that he
  not only meditated it, but was perfectly capable of attempting it, I
  covered my eyes with my hands.</p>
<p>"'Are you ill, Mr. Kensett?' asked the girl, quietly.</p>
<p>"I raised my head indignantly. 'Not at all, Miss Wyeth, only I'll bid
  you good-evening, for this is the nineteenth century, and I'm a
  Christian.'</p>
<p>"'So am I,' she said. 'So is my father.'</p>
<p>"'The devil he is,' I thought.</p>
<p>"Her next words made me jump.</p>
<p>"'Please do not be profane, Mr. Kensett.'</p>
<p>"How did she know I was profane? I had not spoken a word! Could it be
  possible she was able to read my thoughts? This was too much, and I
  rose.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>"'I have the honor to bid you good-evening,' I began, and reluctantly
  turned to include the professor, expecting to see that gentleman
  balancing himself on his chair. The professor's chair was empty.</p>
<p>"'Oh,' said the girl, smiling, 'my father has gone.'</p>
<p>"'Gone! Where?'</p>
<p>"'To—to India, I believe.'</p>
<p>"I sank helplessly into my own chair.</p>
<p>"'I do not think he will stay very long—he promised to return by
  eleven,' she said, timidly.</p>
<p>"I tried to realize the purport of it all. 'Gone to India? Gone! How?
  On a broomstick? Good Heavens,' I murmured, 'am I insane?'</p>
<p>"'Perfectly,' she said, 'and I am tired; you may take me back to the
  hotel.'</p>
<p>"I scarcely heard her; I was feebly attempting to gather up my numbed
  wits. Slowly I began to comprehend the situation, to review the
  startling and humiliating events of the day. At noon, in the court of
  the Hôtel St. Antoine, I had been annoyed by a man and a cat. I had
  retired to my own room and had slept until dinner. In the evening I
  met two tourists on the sea-wall promenade. I had been beguiled into
  conversation—yes, into intimacy with these two tourists! I had had
  the intention of embracing the faith of Pythagoras! Then I had mewed
  like a cat with all the strength of my lungs. Now the male tourist
  vanishes—and leaves me in charge of the female tourist, alone and at
  night in a strange city! And now the female tourist proposes that I
  take her home!</p>
<p>"With a remnant of self-possession I groped for my eye-glass, seized
  it, screwed it firmly into my eye, and <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>looked long and earnestly at
  the girl. As I looked, my eyes softened, my monacle dropped, and I
  forgot everything in the beauty and purity of the face before me. My
  heart began to beat against my stiff, white waistcoat. Had I
  dared—yes, dared to think of this wondrous little beauty as a female
  tourist? Her pale, sweet face, turned towards the sea, seemed to cast
  a spell upon the night. How loud my heart was beating! The yellow moon
  floated, half dipping in the sea, flooding land and water with
  enchanted lights. Wind and wave seemed to feel the spell of her eyes,
  for the breeze died away, the heaving Scheldt tossed noiselessly, and
  the dark Dutch luggers swung idly on the tide with every sail adroop.</p>
<p>"A sudden hush fell over land and water, the voices on the promenade
  were stilled; little by little the shadowy throng, the terrace, the
  sea itself vanished, and I only saw her face, shadowed against the
  moon.</p>
<p>"It seemed as if I had drifted miles above the earth, through all
  space and eternity, and there was naught between me and high heaven
  but that white face. Ah, how I loved her! I knew it—I never doubted
  it. Could years of passionate adoration touch her heart—her little
  heart, now beating so calmly with no thought of love to startle it
  from its quiet and send it fluttering against the gentle breast? In
  her lap her clasped hands tightened—her eyelids drooped as though
  some pleasant thought was passing. I saw the color dye her temples, I
  saw the blue eyes turn, half frightened, to my own, I saw—and I knew
  she had read my thoughts. Then we both rose, side by side, and she was
  weeping softly, yet for my life I dared not speak. She turned away,
  touching her eyes <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>with a bit of lace, and I sprang to her side and
  offered her my arm.</p>
<p>"'You cannot go back alone,' I said.</p>
<p>"She did not take my arm.</p>
<p>"'Do you hate me, Miss Wyeth?'</p>
<p>"'I am very tired,' she said; 'I must go home.'</p>
<p>"'You cannot go alone.'</p>
<p>"'I do not care to accept your escort.'</p>
<p>"'Then—you send me away?'</p>
<p>"'No,' she said, in a hard voice. 'You can come if you like.' So I
  humbly attended her to the Hôtel St. Antoine.</p>

</p><p>"As we reached the Place Verte and turned into the court of the hotel,
  the sound of the midnight bells swept over the city, and a horse-car
  jingled slowly by on its last trip to the railroad station.</p>
<p>"We passed the fountain, bubbling and splashing in the moonlit court,
  and, crossing the square, entered the southern wing of the hotel. At
  the foot of the stairway she leaned for an instant against the
  banisters.</p>
<p>"'I am afraid we have walked too fast,' I said.</p>
<p>"She turned to me coldly. 'No—conventionalities must be observed. You
  were quite right in escaping as soon as possible.'</p>

<p>"She gave a little movement of impatience. 'Don't,' she said, 'you
  tire me—conventionalities tire me. Be satisfied—nobody has seen
  you.'</p>
<p>"'You are cruel,' I said, in a low voice—'what do you think I care
  for conventionalities?'</p>
<p>"'You care everything—you care what people think, and you try to do
  what they say is good form. You never did such an original thing in
  your life as you have just done.'</p>
<p>"'You read my thoughts,' I exclaimed, bitterly. 'It is not fair—'</p>
<p>"'Fair or not, I know what you consider me—ill-bred, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>common, pleased
  with any sort of attention. Oh! why should I waste one word—one
  thought on you?'</p>
<p>"'Miss Wyeth—' I began, but she interrupted me.</p>
<p>"'Would you dare tell me what you think of me?—Would you dare tell me
  what you think of my father?'</p>
<p>"I was silent. She turned and mounted two steps of the stairway, then
  faced me again.</p>
<p>"'Do you think it was for my own pleasure that I permitted myself to
  be left alone with you? Do you imagine that I am flattered by your
  attention?—do you venture to think I ever could be? How dared you
  think what you did think there on the sea-wall?'</p>
<p>"'I cannot help my thoughts!' I replied.</p>
<p>"'You turned on me like a tiger when you awoke from your trance. Do
  you really suppose that you mewed? Are you not aware that my father
  hypnotized you?'</p>
<p>"'No—I did not know it,' I said. The hot blood tingled in my
  finger-tips, and I looked angrily at her.</p>
<p>"'Why do you imagine that I waste my time on you?' she said. 'Your
  vanity has answered that question—now let your intelligence answer
  it. I am a Pythagorean; I have been chosen to bring in a convert, and
  you were the convert selected for me by the Mahatmas of the
  Consolidated Trust Company. I have followed you from New York to
  Antwerp, as I was bidden, but now my courage fails, and I shrink from
  fulfilling my mission, knowing you to be the type of man you are. If I
  could give it up—if I could only go away—never, never again to see
  you! Ah, I fear they will not permit it!—until my mission is
  accomplished. Why was I <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>chosen—I, with a woman's heart and a woman's
  pride. I—I hate you!'</p>
<p>"'I love you,' I said, slowly.</p>
<p>"She paled and looked away.</p>
<p>"'Answer me,' I said.</p>
<p>"Her wide, blue eyes turned back again, and I held them with mine. At
  last she slowly drew a long-stemmed rose from the bunch at her belt,
  turned, and mounted the shadowy staircase. For a moment I thought I
  saw her pause on the landing above, but the moonlight was uncertain.
  After waiting for a long time in vain, I moved away, and in going
  raised my hand to my face, but I stopped short, and my heart stopped
  too, for a moment. In my hand I held a long-stemmed rose.</p>
<p>"With my brain in a whirl I crept across the court and mounted the
  stairs to my room. Hour after hour I walked the floor, slowly at
  first, then more rapidly, but it brought no calm to the fierce tumult
  of my thoughts, and at last I dropped into a chair before the empty
  fireplace, burying my head in my hands.</p>
<p>"Uncertain, shocked, and deadly weary, I tried to think—I strove to
  bring order out of the chaos in my brain, but I only sat staring at
  the long-stemmed rose. Slowly I began to take a vague pleasure in its
  heavy perfume, and once I crushed a leaf between my palms, and,
  bending over, drank in the fragrance.</p>
<p>"Twice my lamp flickered and went out, and twice, treading softly, I
  crossed the room to relight it. Twice I threw open the door, thinking
  that I heard some sound without. How close the air was!—how heavy and
  hot! And what was that strange, subtle odor which had insensibly
  filled the room? It grew stronger and more <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>penetrating, and I began
  to dislike it, and to escape it I buried my nose in the half-opened
  rose. Horror! The odor came from the rose—and the rose itself was no
  longer a rose—not even a flower now—it was only a bunch of catnip;
  and I dashed it to the floor and ground it under my heel.</p>
<p>"'Mountebank!' I cried, in a rage. My anger grew cold—and I shivered,
  drawn perforce to the curtained window. Something was there, outside.
  I could not hear it, for it made no sound, but I knew it was there,
  watching me. What was it? The damp hair stirred on my head. I touched
  the heavy curtains. Whatever was outside them sprang up, tore at the
  window, and then rushed away.</p>
<p>"Feeling very shaky, I crept to the window, opened it, and leaned out.
  The night was calm. I heard the fountain splashing in the moonlight
  and the sea-winds soughing through the palms. Then I closed the window
  and turned back into the room; and as I stood there a sudden breeze,
  which could not have come from without, blew sharply in my face,
  extinguishing the candle and sending the long curtains bellying out
  into the room. The lamp on the table flashed and smoked and sputtered;
  the room was littered with flying papers and catnip leaves. Then the
  strange wind died away, and somewhere in the night a cat snarled.</p>
<p>"I turned desperately to my trunk and flung it open. Into it I threw
  everything I owned, pell-mell, closed the lid, locked it, and, seizing
  my mackintosh and travelling-bag, ran down the stairs, crossed the
  court, and entered the night-office of the hotel. There I called up
  the sleepy clerk, settled my reckoning, and sent a porter for a cab.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>"'Now,' I said, 'what time does the next train leave?'</p>
<p>"'The next train for where?'</p>
<p>"'Anywhere!'</p>
<p>"The clerk locked the safe, and, carefully keeping the desk between
  himself and me, motioned the office-boy to look at the time-tables.</p>
<p>"'Next train, 2.10. Brussels—Paris,' read the boy.</p>
<p>"At that moment the cab rattled up by the curbstone, and I sprang in
  while the porter tossed my traps on top. Away we bumped over the stony
  pavement, past street after street lighted dimly by tall gas-lamps,
  and alley after alley brilliant with the glare of villanous all-night
  café-concerts, and then, turning, we rumbled past the Circus and the
  Eldorado, and at last stopped with a jolt before the Brussels station.</p>
<p>"I had not a moment to lose. 'Paris!' I cried—'first-class!' and,
  pocketing the book of coupons, hurried across the platform to where
  the Brussels train lay. A guard came running up, flung open the door
  of a first-class carriage, slammed and locked it after I had jumped
  in, and the long train glided from the arched station out into the
  starlit morning.</p>
<p>"I was all alone in the compartment. The wretched lamp in the roof
  flickered dimly, scarcely lighting the stuffy box. I could not see to
  read my time-table, so I wrapped my legs in the travelling-rug and lay
  back, staring out into the misty morning. Trees, walls,
  telegraph-poles flashed past, and the cinders drove in showers against
  the rattling windows. I slept at times, fitfully, and once, springing
  up, peered sharply at the opposite seat, possessed with the idea that
  somebody was there.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>"When the train reached Brussels I was sound asleep, and the guard
  awoke me with difficulty.</p>
<p>"'Breakfast, sir?' he asked.</p>
<p>"'Anything,' I sighed, and stepped out to the platform, rubbing my
  legs and shivering. The other passengers were already breakfasting in
  the station café, and I joined them and managed to swallow a cup of
  coffee and a roll.</p>
<p>"The morning broke gray and cloudy, and I bundled myself into my
  mackintosh for a tramp along the platform. Up and down I stamped,
  puffing a cigar, and digging my hands deep in my pockets, while the
  other passengers huddled into the warmer compartments of the train or
  stood watching the luggage being lifted into the forward
  mail-carriage. The wait was very long; the hands of the great clock
  pointed to six, and still the train lay motionless along the platform.
  I approached a guard and asked him whether anything was wrong.</p>
<p>"'Accident on the line,' he replied; 'monsieur had better go to his
  compartment and try to sleep, for we may be delayed until noon.'</p>
<p>"I followed the guard's advice, and, crawling into my corner, wrapped
  myself in the rug and lay back watching the rain-drops spattering
  along the window-sill. At noon the train had not moved, and I lunched
  in the compartment. At four o'clock in the afternoon the
  station-master came hurrying along the platform, crying, 'Montez!
  montez! messieurs, s'il vous plaît'—and the train steamed out of the
  station and whirled away through the flat, treeless Belgian plains. At
  times I dozed, but the shaking of the car always awoke me, and I would
  sit blinking out at the endless <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>stretch of plain, until a sudden
  flurry of rain blotted the landscape from my eyes. At last a long,
  shrill whistle from the engine, a jolt, a series of bumps, and an
  apparition of red trousers and bayonets warned me that we had arrived
  at the French frontier. I turned out with the others, and opened my
  valise for inspection, but the customs officials merely chalked it,
  without examination, and I hurried back to my compartment amid the
  shouting of guards and the clanging of station bells. Again I found
  that I was alone in the compartment, so I smoked a cigarette, thanked
  Heaven, and fell into a dreamless sleep.</p>
<p>"How long I slept I do not know, but when I awoke the train was
  roaring through a tunnel. When again it flashed out into the open
  country I peered through the grimy, rain-stained window and saw that
  the storm had ceased and stars were twinkling in the sky. I stretched
  my legs, yawned, pushed my travelling-cap back from my forehead, and,
  stumbling to my feet, walked up and down the compartment until my
  cramped muscles were relieved. Then I sat down again, and, lighting a
  cigar, puffed great rings and clouds of fragrant smoke across the
  aisle.</p>
<p>"The train was flying; the cars lurched and shook, and the windows
  rattled accompaniment to the creaking panels. The smoke from my cigar
  dimmed the lamp in the ceiling and hid the opposite seat from view.
  How it curled and writhed in the corners, now eddying upward, now
  floating across the aisle like a veil! I lounged back in my cushioned
  seat, watching it with interest. What queer shapes it took! How thick
  it was becoming!—how strangely luminous! Now it had filled the whole
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>compartment, puff after puff crowding upward, waving, wavering,
  clouding the windows, and blotting the lamp from sight. It was most
  interesting. I had never before smoked such a cigar. What an
  extraordinary brand! I examined the end, flicking the ashes away. The
  cigar was out. Fumbling for a match to relight it, my eyes fell on the
  drifting smoke-curtain which swayed across the corner opposite. It
  seemed almost tangible. How like a real curtain it hung, gray,
  impenetrable! A man might hide behind it. Then an idea came into my
  head, and it persisted until my uneasiness amounted to a vague terror.
  I tried to fight it off—I strove to resist—but the conviction slowly
  settled upon me that something was behind that smoke-veil—something
  which had entered the compartment while I slept.</p>
<p>"'It can't be,' I muttered, my eyes fixed on the misty drapery; 'the
  train has not stopped.'</p>
<p>"The car creaked and trembled. I sprang to my feet and swept my arm
  through the veil of smoke. Then my hair rose on my head. For my hand
  touched another hand, and my eyes had met two other eyes.</p>
<p>"I heard a voice in the gloom, low and sweet, calling me by name; I
  saw the eyes again, tender and blue; soft fingers touched my own.</p>
<p>"'Are you afraid?' she said.</p>
<p>"My heart began to beat again, and my face warmed with returning
  blood.</p>
<p>"'It is only I,' she said, gently.</p>
<p>"I seemed to hear my own voice speaking as if at a great distance,
  'You here—alone?'</p>
<p>"'How cruel of you!' she faltered; 'I am not alone.' At the same
  instant my eyes fell upon the professor, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>calmly seated by the farther
  window. His hands were thrust into the folds of a corded and tasselled
  dressing-gown, from beneath which peeped two enormous feet encased in
  carpet slippers. Upon his head towered a yellow night-cap. He did not
  pay the slightest attention to either me or his daughter, and, except
  for the lighted cigar which he kept shifting between his lips, he
  might have been taken for a wax dummy.</p>
<p>"Then I began to speak, feebly, hesitating like a child.</p>
<p>"'How did you come into this compartment? You—you do not possess
  wings, I suppose? You could not have been here all the time. Will you
  explain—explain to me? See, I ask you very humbly, for I do not
  understand. This is the nineteenth century, and these things don't fit
  in. I'm wearing a Dunlap hat—I've got a copy of the New York <i>Herald</i>
  in my bag—President Roosevelt is alive, and everything is so very
  unromantic in the world! Is this real magic? Perhaps I'm filled with
  hallucinations. Perhaps I'm asleep and dreaming. Perhaps you are not
  really here—nor I—nor anybody, nor anything!'</p>
<p>"The train plunged into a tunnel, and when again it dashed out from
  the other end the cold wind blew furiously in my face from the farther
  window. It was wide open; the professor was gone.</p>
<p>"'Papa has changed to another compartment,' she said, quietly. 'I
  think perhaps you were beginning to bore him.'</p>
<p>"Her eyes met mine and she smiled.</p>
<p>"'Are you very much bewildered?'</p>
<p>"I looked at her in silence. She sat very quietly, her <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>hands clasped
  above her knee, her curly hair glittering to her girdle. A long robe,
  almost silvery in the twilight, clung to her young figure; her bare
  feet were thrust deep into a pair of shimmering Eastern slippers.</p>
<p>"'When you fled,' she sighed, 'I was asleep and there was no time to
  lose. I barely had a moment to go to Bombay, to find papa, and return
  in time to join you. This is an East-Indian costume.'</p>
<p>"Still I was silent.</p>
<p>"'Are you shocked?' she asked, simply.</p>
<p>"'No,' I replied, in a dull voice, 'I'm past that.'</p>
<p>"'You are very rude,' she said, with the tears starting to her eyes.</p>
<p>"'I do not mean to be. I only wish to go away—away somewhere and find
  out what my name is.'</p>
<p>"'Your name is Harold Kensett.'</p>
<p>"'Are you sure?' I asked, eagerly.</p>
<p>"'Yes—what troubles you?'</p>
<p>"'Is everything plain to you? Are you a sort of prophet and
  second-sight medium? Is nothing hidden from you?' I asked.</p>
<p>"'Nothing,' she faltered. My head ached and I clasped it in my hand.</p>
<p>"A sudden change came over her. 'I am human—believe me!' she said,
  with piteous eagerness. 'Indeed, I do not seem strange to those who
  understand. You wonder, because you left me at midnight in Antwerp and
  you wake to find me here. If, because I find myself reincarnated,
  endowed with senses and capabilities which few at present possess—if
  I am so made, why should it seem strange? It is all so natural to me.
  If I appear to you—'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>"'Appear?'</p>
<p>"'Yes—'</p>
<p>"'Wilhelmina!' I cried; 'can you vanish?'</p>
<p>"'Yes,' she murmured; 'does it seem to you unmaidenly?'</p>
<p>"'Great Heaven!' I groaned.</p>
<p>"'Don't!' she cried, with tears in her voice—'oh, please don't! Help
  me to bear it! If you only knew how awful it is to be different from
  other girls—how mortifying it is to me to be able to vanish—oh, how
  I hate and detest it all!'</p>
<p>"'Don't cry,' I said, looking at her pityingly.</p>
<p>"'Oh, dear me!' she sobbed. 'You shudder at the sight of me because I
  can vanish.'</p>
<p>"'I don't!' I cried.</p>
<p>"'Yes, you do! You abhor me—you shrink away! Oh, why did I ever see
  you?—why did you ever come into my life?—what have I done in ages
  past, that now, reborn, I suffer cruelly—cruelly?'</p>
<p>"'What do you mean?' I whispered. My voice trembled with happiness.</p>
<p>"'I?—nothing; but you think me a fabled monster.'</p>
<p>"'Wilhelmina—my sweet Wilhelmina,' I said, 'I don't think you a
  fabled monster. I love you; see—see—I am at your feet; listen to me,
  my darling—'</p>
<p>"She turned her blue eyes to mine. I saw tears sparkling on the curved
  lashes.</p>
<p>"'Wilhelmina, I love you,' I said again.</p>
<p>"Slowly she raised her hands to my head and held it a moment, looking
  at me strangely. Then her face grew nearer to my own, her glittering
  hair fell over my shoulders, her lips rested on mine.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>"In that long, sweet kiss the beating of her heart answered mine, and
  I learned a thousand truths, wonderful, mysterious, splendid; but when
  our lips fell apart, the memory of what I learned departed also.</p>
<p>"'It was so very simple and beautiful,' she sighed, 'and I—I never
  saw it. But the Mahatmas knew—ah, they knew that my mission could
  only be accomplished through love.'</p>
<p>"'And it is,' I whispered, 'for you shall teach me—me, your husband.'</p>
<p>"'And—and you will not be impatient? You will try to believe?'</p>
<p>"'I will believe what you tell me, my sweetheart.'</p>
<p>"'Even about—cats?'</p>
<p>"Before I could reply the farther window opened and a yellow
  night-cap, followed by the professor, entered from somewhere without.
  Wilhelmina sank back on her sofa, but the professor needed not to be
  told, and we both knew he was already busily reading our thoughts.</p>
<p>"For a moment there was dead silence—long enough for the professor to
  grasp the full significance of what had passed. Then he uttered a
  single exclamation, 'Oh!'</p>
<p>"After a while, however, he looked at me for the first time that
  evening, saying, 'Congratulate you, Mr. Kensett, I'm sure,' tied
  several knots in the cord of his dressing-gown, lighted a cigar, and
  paid no further attention to either of us. Some moments later he
  opened the window again and disappeared. I looked across the aisle at
  Wilhelmina.</p>
<p>"'You may come over beside me,' she said, shyly.</p>

<p><br>
</p><p>"It was nearly ten o'clock and our train was rapidly approaching
  Paris. We passed village after village wrapped in mist, station after
  station hung with twinkling red and blue and yellow lanterns, then
  sped on again with the echo of the switch-bells ringing in our ears.</p>
<p>"When at length the train slowed up and stopped, I opened the window
  and looked out upon a long, wet platform, shining under the electric
  lights.</p>
<p>"A guard came running by, throwing open the doors of each compartment,
  and crying, 'Paris next! Tickets, if you please.'</p>
<p>"I handed him my book of coupons, from which he tore several and
  handed it back. Then he lifted his lantern and peered into the
  compartment, saying, 'Is monsieur alone?'</p>
<p>"I turned to Wilhelmina.</p>
<p>"'He wants your ticket—give it to me.'</p>
<p>"'What's that?' demanded the guard.</p>
<p>"I looked anxiously at Wilhelmina.</p>
<p>"'If your father has the tickets—' I began, but was interrupted by
  the guard, who snapped:</p>
<p>"'Monsieur will give himself the trouble to remember that I do not
  understand English.'</p>
<p>"'Keep quiet!' I said, sharply, in French. 'I am not speaking to
  you.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>"The guard stared stupidly at me, then, at my luggage, and finally,
  entering the car, knelt down and peered under the seats. Presently he
  got up, very red in the face, and went out slamming the door. He had
  not paid the slightest attention to Wilhelmina, but I distinctly heard
  him say, 'Only Englishmen and idiots talk to themselves!'</p>
<p>"'Wilhelmina,' I faltered, 'do you mean to say that that guard could
  not see you?'</p>
<p>"She began to look so serious again that I merely added, 'Never mind,
  I don't care whether you are invisible or not, dearest.'</p>
<p>"'I am not invisible to you,' she said; 'why should you care?'</p>
<p>"A great noise of bells and whistles drowned our voices, and, amid the
  whirring of switch-bells, the hissing of steam, and the cries of
  'Paris! All out!' our train glided into the station.</p>
<p>"It was the professor who opened the door of our carriage. There he
  stood, calmly adjusting his yellow night-cap and drawing his
  dressing-gown closer with the corded tassels.</p>
<p>"'Where have you been?' I asked.</p>
<p>"'On the engine.'</p>
<p>"'<i>In</i> the engine, I suppose you mean,' I said.</p>
<p>"'No, I don't; I mean <i>on</i> the engine—on the pilot. It was very
  refreshing. Where are we going now?'</p>
<p>"'Do you know Paris?' asked Wilhelmina, turning to me.</p>
<p>"'Yes. I think your father had better take you to the Hôtel Normandie
  on the Rue de l'Échelle—'</p>
<p>"'But you must stay there, too!'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>"'Of course—if you wish—'</p>
<p>"She laughed nervously.</p>
<p>"'Don't you see that my father and I could not take rooms—now? You
  must engage three rooms for yourself.'</p>
<p>"'Why?' I asked, stupidly.</p>
<p>"'Oh, dear—why, because we are invisible.'</p>
<p>"I tried to repress a shudder. The professor gave Wilhelmina his arm,
  and, as I studied his ensemble, I thanked Heaven that he was
  invisible.</p>
<p>"At the gate of the station I hailed a four-seated cab, and we rattled
  away through the stony streets, brilliant with gas-jets, and in a few
  moments rolled smoothly across the Avenue de l'Opéra, turned into the
  Rue de l'Échelle, and stopped. A bright little page, all over buttons,
  came out, took my luggage, and preceded us into the hallway.</p>
<p>"I, with Wilhelmina on my arm and the professor shuffling along beside
  me, walked over to the desk.</p>
<p>"'Room?' said the clerk. 'We have a very desirable room on the second,
  fronting the Rue St. Honoré—'</p>
<p>"'But we—that is, I want three rooms—three separate rooms!' I said.</p>
<p>"The clerk scratched his chin. 'Monsieur is expecting friends?'</p>
<p>"'Say yes,' whispered Wilhelmina, with a suspicion of laughter in her
  voice.</p>
<p>"'Yes,' I repeated, feebly.</p>
<p>"'Gentlemen, of course?' said the clerk, looking at me narrowly.</p>
<p>"'One lady.'</p>
<p>"'Married, of course?'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>"'What's that to you?' I said, sharply. 'What do you mean by speaking
  to us—'</p>
<p>"'Us!'</p>
<p>"'I mean to me,' I said, badly rattled; 'give me the rooms and let me
  get to bed, will you?'</p>
<p>"'Monsieur will remember,' said the clerk, coldly, 'that this is an
  old and respectable hotel.'</p>
<p>"'I know it,' I said, smothering my rage.</p>
<p>"The clerk eyed me suspiciously.</p>
<p>"'Front!' he called, with irritating deliberation. 'Show this
  gentleman to apartment ten.'</p>
<p>"'How many rooms are there!' I demanded.</p>
<p>"'Three sleeping-rooms and a parlor.'</p>
<p>"'I will take it,' I said, with composure.</p>
<p>"'On probation,' muttered the clerk, insolently.</p>
<p>"Swallowing the insult, I followed the bell-boy up the stairs, keeping
  between him and Wilhelmina, for I dreaded to see him walk through her
  as if she were thin air. A trim maid rose to meet us and conducted us
  through a hallway into a large apartment. She threw open all the
  bedroom-doors and said, 'Will monsieur have the goodness to choose?'</p>
<p>"'Which will you take,' I began, turning to Wilhelmina.</p>
<p>"'I? Monsieur!' cried the startled maid.</p>
<p>"That completely upset me. 'Here,' I muttered, slipping some silver
  into her hand; 'now, for the love of Heaven, run away!'</p>
<p>"When she had vanished with a doubtful 'Merci, monsieur!' I handed the
  professor the keys and asked him to settle the thing with Wilhelmina.</p>
<p>"Wilhelmina took the corner room, the professor <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>rambled into the next
  one, and I said good-night and crept wearily into my own chamber. I
  sat down and tried to think. A great feeling of fatigue weighted my
  spirits.</p>
<p>"'I can think better with my clothes off,' I said, and slipped the
  coat from my shoulders. How tired I was! 'I can think better in bed,'
  I muttered, flinging my cravat on the dresser and tossing my
  shirt-studs after it. I was certainly very tired. 'Now,' I yawned,
  grasping the pillow and drawing it under my head—'now I can think a
  bit.' But before my head fell on the pillow sleep closed my eyes.</p>
<p>"I began to dream at once. It seemed as though my eyes were wide open
  and the professor was standing beside my bed.</p>
<p>"'Young man,' he said, 'you've won my daughter and you must pay the
  piper!'</p>
<p>"'What piper?' I said.</p>
<p>"'The Pied Piper of Hamelin, I don't think,' replied the professor,
  vulgarly, and before I could realize what he was doing he had drawn a
  reed pipe from his dressing-gown and was playing a strangely annoying
  air. Then an awful thing occurred. Cats began to troop into the room,
  cats by the hundred—toms and tabbies, gray, yellow, Maltese, Persian,
  Manx—all purring and all marching round and round, rubbing against
  the furniture, the professor, and even against me. I struggled with
  the nightmare.</p>
<p>"'Take them away!' I tried to gasp.</p>
<p>"'Nonsense!' he said; 'here is an old friend.'</p>
<p>"I saw the white tabby cat of the Hôtel St. Antoine.</p>
<p>"'An old friend,' he repeated, and played a dismal melody on his
  reed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>"I saw Wilhelmina enter the room, lift the white tabby in her arms,
  and bring her to my side.</p>
<p>"'Shake hands with him,' she commanded.</p>
<p>"To my horror the tabby deliberately extended a paw and tapped me on
  the knuckles.</p>
<p>"'Oh!' I cried, in agony; 'this is a horrible dream! Why, oh, why
  can't I wake!'</p>
<p>"'Yes,' she said, dropping the cat, 'it is partly a dream, but some of
  it is real. Remember what I say, my darling; you are to go to-morrow
  morning and meet the twelve-o'clock train from Antwerp at the Gare du
  Nord. Papa and I are coming to Paris on that train. Don't you know
  that we are not really here now, you silly boy? Good-night, then. I
  shall be very glad to see you.'</p>
<p>"I saw her glide from the room, followed by the professor, playing a
  gay quick-step, to which the cats danced two and two.</p>
<p>"'Good-night, sir,' said each cat as it passed my bed; and I dreamed
  no more.</p>
<p>"When I awoke, the room, the bed had vanished; I was in the street,
  walking rapidly; the sun shone down on the broad, white pavements of
  Paris, and the streams of busy life flowed past me on either side. How
  swiftly I was walking! Where the devil was I going? Surely I had
  business somewhere that needed immediate attention. I tried to
  remember when I had awakened, but I could not. I wondered where I had
  dressed myself; I had apparently taken great pains with my toilet, for
  I was immaculate, monocle and all, even down to a long-stemmed rose
  nestling in my button-hole. I knew Paris and recognized the streets
  through which I was hurrying. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>Where could I be going? What was my
  hurry? I glanced at my watch and found I had not a moment to lose.
  Then, as the bells of the city rang out mid-day, I hastened into the
  railroad station on the Rue Lafayette and walked out to the platform.
  And as I looked down the glittering track, around the distant curve
  shot a locomotive followed by a long line of cars. Nearer and nearer
  it came, while the station-gongs sounded and the switch-bells began
  ringing all along the track.</p>
<p>"'Antwerp express!' cried the sous-chef de gare, and as the train
  slipped along the tiled platform I sprang upon the steps of a
  first-class carriage and threw open the door.</p>
<p>"'How do you do, Mr. Kensett?' said Wilhelmina Wyeth, springing
  lightly to the platform. 'Really it is very nice of you to come to the
  train.' At the same moment a bald, mild-eyed gentleman emerged from
  the depths of the same compartment, carrying a large, covered basket.</p>
<p>"'How are you, Kensett?' he said. 'Glad to see you again. Rather warm
  in that compartment—no, I will not trust this basket to an
  expressman; give Wilhelmina your arm and I'll follow. We go to the
  Normandie, I believe?'</p>
<p>"All the morning I had Wilhelmina to myself, and at dinner I sat
  beside her, with the professor opposite. The latter was cheerful
  enough, but he nearly ruined my appetite, for he smelled strongly of
  catnip. After dinner he became restless and fidgeted about in his
  chair until coffee was brought, and we went up to the parlor of our
  apartment. Here his restlessness <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>increased to such an extent that I
  ventured to ask him if he was in good health.</p>
<p>"'It's that basket—the covered basket which I have in the next room,'
  he said.</p>
<p>"'What's the trouble with the basket?' I asked.</p>
<p>"'The basket's all right—but the contents worry me.'</p>
<p>"'May I inquire what the contents are?' I ventured.</p>
<p>"The professor rose.</p>
<p>"'Yes,' he said, 'you may inquire of my daughter.' He left the room,
  but reappeared shortly, carrying a saucer of milk.</p>
<p>"I watched him enter the next room, which was mine.</p>
<p>"'What on earth is he taking that into my room for?' I asked
  Wilhelmina. 'I don't keep cats.'</p>
<p>"'But you will,' she said.</p>
<p>"'I? Never!'</p>
<p>"'You will if I ask you to.'</p>
<p>"'But—but you won't ask me.'</p>
<p>"'But I do.'</p>
<p>"'Wilhelmina!'</p>
<p>"'Harold!'</p>
<p>"'I detest cats.'</p>
<p>"'You must not.'</p>
<p>"'I can't help it.'</p>
<p>"'You will when I ask it. Have I not given myself to you? Will you not
  make a little sacrifice for me?'</p>
<p>"'I don't understand—'</p>
<p>"'Would you refuse my first request?'</p>
<p>"'No,' I said, miserably, 'I will keep dozens of cats—'</p>
<p>"'I do not ask that; I only wish you to keep one.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>"'Was that what your father had in that basket?' I asked,
  suspiciously.</p>
<p>"'Yes, the basket came from Antwerp.'</p>
<p>"'What! The white Antwerp cat!' I cried.</p>
<p>"'Yes.'</p>
<p>"'And you ask me to keep that cat? Oh, Wilhelmina!'</p>
<p>"'Listen!' she said. 'I have a long story to tell you; come nearer,
  close to me. You say you love me?'</p>
<p>"I bent and kissed her.</p>
<p>"'Then I shall put you to the proof,' she murmured.</p>
<p>"'Prove me!'</p>
<p>"'Listen. That cat is the same cat that ran out of the apartment in
  the Waldorf when your great-aunt ceased to exist—in human shape. My
  father and myself, having received word from the Mahatmas of the Trust
  Company, sheltered and cherished the cat. We were ordered by the
  Mahatmas to convert you. The task was appalling—but there is no such
  thing as refusing a command, and we laid our plans. That man with a
  white spot in his hair was my father—'</p>
<p>"'What! Your father is bald.'</p>
<p>"'He wore a wig then. The white spot came from dropping chemicals on
  the wig while experimenting with a substance which you could not
  comprehend.'</p>
<p>"'Then—then that clew was useless; but who could have taken the
  Crimson Diamond? And who was the man with the white spot on his head
  who tried to sell the stone in Paris?'</p>
<p>"'That was my father.'</p>
<p>"'He—he—st—took the Crimson Diamond!' I cried, aghast.</p>
<p>"'Yes and no. That was only a paste stone that he <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>had in Paris. It
  was to draw you over here. He had the real Crimson Diamond also.'</p>
<p>"'Your father?'</p>
<p>"'Yes. He has it in the next room now. Can you not see how it
  disappeared, Harold? Why, the cat swallowed it!'</p>
<p>"'Do you mean to say that the white tabby swallowed the Crimson
  Diamond?'</p>
<p>"'By mistake. She tried to get it out of the velvet bag, and, as the
  bag was also full of catnip, she could not resist a mouthful, and
  unfortunately just then you broke in the door and so startled the cat
  that she swallowed the Crimson Diamond.'</p>
<p>"There was a painful pause. At last I said:</p>
<p>"'Wilhelmina, as you are able to vanish, I suppose you also are able
  to converse with cats.'</p>
<p>"'I am,' she replied, trying to keep back the tears of mortification.</p>
<p>"'And that cat told you this?'</p>
<p>"'She did.'</p>
<p>"'And my Crimson Diamond is inside that cat?'</p>
<p>"'It is.'</p>
<p>"'Then,' said I, firmly, 'I am going to chloroform the cat.'</p>
<p>"'Harold!' she cried, in terror, 'that cat is your great-aunt!'</p>
<p>"I don't know to this day how I stood the shock of that announcement,
  or how I managed to listen while Wilhelmina tried to explain the
  transmigration theory, but it was all Chinese to me. I only knew that
  I was a blood relation of a cat, and the thought nearly drove me mad.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>"'Try, my darling, try to love her,' whispered Wilhelmina; 'she must
  be very precious to you—'</p>
<p>"'Yes, with my diamond inside her,' I replied, faintly.</p>
<p>"'You must not neglect her,' said Wilhelmina.</p>
<p>"'Oh no, I'll always have my eye on her—I mean I will surround her
  with luxury—er, milk and bones and catnip and books—er—does she
  read?'</p>
<p>"'Not the books that human beings read. Now, go and speak to your
  aunt, Harold.'</p>
<p>"'Eh! How the deuce—'</p>
<p>"'Go; for my sake try to be cordial.'</p>
<p>"She rose and led me unresistingly to the door of my room.</p>
<p>"'Good Heavens!' I groaned; 'this is awful.'</p>
<p>"'Courage, my darling!' she whispered. 'Be brave for love of me.'</p>
<p>"I drew her to me and kissed her. Beads of cold perspiration started
  in the roots of my hair, but I clenched my teeth and entered the room
  alone. The room was dark and I stood silent, not knowing where to
  turn, fearful lest I step on my aunt! Then, through the dreary
  silence, I called, 'Aunty!'</p>
<p>"A faint noise broke upon my ear, and my heart grew sick, but I strode
  into the darkness, calling, hoarsely:</p>
<p>"'Aunt Tabby! It is your nephew!'</p>
<p>"Again the faint sound. Something was stirring there among the
  shadows—a shape moving softly along the wall, a shade which glided by
  me, paused, wavered, and darted under the bed. Then I threw myself on
  the floor, profoundly moved, begging, imploring my aunt to come to
  me.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>"'Aunty! Aunty!' I murmured. 'Your nephew is waiting to take you to
  his heart!'</p>
<p>"At last I saw my great-aunt's eyes shining in the dark."</p>
<p>The young man's voice grew hushed and solemn, and he lifted his hand
  in silence:</p>
<p>"Close the door. That meeting is not for the eyes of the world! Close
  the door upon that sacred scene where great-aunt and nephew are united
  at last."</p>
<hr style="width: 15%; padding-top: 1.25em; padding-bottom: 1.25em;">
<p>A long pause followed; deep emotion was visible in Miss Barrison's
  sensitive face. She said:</p>
<p>"Then—you are married?"</p>
<p>"No," replied Mr. Kensett, in a mortified voice.</p>
<p>"Why not?" I asked, amazed.</p>
<p>"Because," he said, "although my fiancée was prepared to accept a cat
  as her great-aunt, she could not endure the complications that
  followed."</p>
<p>"What complications?" inquired Miss Barrison.</p>
<p>The young man sighed profoundly, shaking his head.</p>
<p>"My great-aunt had kittens," he said, softly.</p>
<hr style="width: 15%; padding-top: 1.25em; padding-bottom: 1.25em;">
<p>The tremendous scientific importance of these experiences excited me
  beyond measure. The simplicity of the narrative, the elaborate
  attention to corroborative detail, all bore irresistible testimony to
  the truth of these accounts of phenomena vitally important to the
  entire world of science.</p>
<p>We all dined together that night—a little earnest company of
  knowledge-seekers in the vast wilderness of the unexplored; and we
  lingered long in the dining-car, propounding questions, advancing
  theories, speculating <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>upon possibilities of most intense interest.
  Never before had I known a man whose relatives were cats and kittens,
  but he did not appear to share my enthusiasm in the matter.</p>
<p>"You see," he said, looking at Miss Barrison, "it may be interesting
  from a purely scientific point of view, but it has already proved a
  bar to my marrying."</p>
<p>"Were the kittens black?" I inquired.</p>
<p>"No," he said, "my aunt drew the color-line, I am proud to say."</p>
<p>"I don't see," said Miss Barrison, "why the fact that your great-aunt
  is a cat should prevent you from marrying."</p>
<p>"It wouldn't prevent <i>me</i>!" said the young man, quickly.</p>
<p>"Nor me," mused Miss Barrison—"if I were really in love."</p>
<p>Meanwhile I had been very busy thinking about Professor Farrago, and,
  coming to an interesting theory, advanced it.</p>
<p>"If," I began, "he marries one of those transparent ladies, what about
  the children?"</p>
<p>"Some would be, no doubt, transparent," said Kensett.</p>
<p>"They might be only translucent," suggested Miss Barrison.</p>
<p>"Or partially opaque," I ventured. "But it's a risky marriage—not to
  be able to see what one's wife is about—"</p>
<p>"That is a silly reflection on women," said Miss Barrison, quietly.
  "Besides, a girl need not be transparent to conceal what she's
  doing."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>This observation seemed to end our postprandial and tripartite
  conference; Miss Barrison retired to her stateroom presently; after a
  last cigar, smoked almost in silence, the young man and I bade each
  other a civil good-night and retired to our respective berths.</p>
<p>I think it was at Richmond, Virginia, that I was awakened by the negro
  porter shaking me very gently and repeating, in a pleasant, monotonous
  voice: "Teleg'am foh you, suh! Teleg'am foh Mistuh Gilland, suh. 'Done
  call you 'lev'm times sense breakfass, suh! Las' call foh luncheon,
  suh. Teleg'am foh—"</p>
<p>"Heavens!" I muttered, sitting up in my bunk, "is it as late as that!
  Where are we?" I slid up the window-shade and sat blinking at a flood
  of sunshine.</p>
<p>"Telegram?" I said, yawning and rubbing my eyes. "Let me have it. All
  right, I'll be out presently. Shut that curtain! I don't want the
  entire car to criticise my pink pajamas!"</p>
<p>"Ain' nobody in de cyar, 'scusin yo'se'f, suh," grinned the porter,
  retiring.</p>
<p>I heard him, but did not comprehend, sitting there sleepily unfolding
  the scrawled telegram. Suddenly my eyes flew wide open; I scanned the
  despatch with stunned incredulity:</p>
<div class="block2">
  <p class="right sc">"Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
  <p>"We couldn't help it. Love at first sight. Married this
    morning in Atlanta. Wildly happy. Forgive. Wire blessing.</p>
  <p class="right" style="margin-right: 5%;">"(Signed) <span class="sc">Harold Kensett</span>,  <br>
    "<span class="sc">Helen Barrison Kensett.</span>"</p>
</div>
<p>"Porter!" I shouted. "Porter! Help!"</p>
<p>There was no response.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>"Oh, Lord!" I groaned, and rolled over, burying my head in the
  blankets; for I understood at last that Science, the most jealous,
  most exacting of mistresses, could never brook a rival.</p>

    Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
  </div>

  <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
    Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
    electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
    computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
    exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
    from people in all walks of life.
  </div>

  <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
    Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
    assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
    goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
    remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
    Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
    and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
    generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
    Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
    Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

    Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
  </div>

  <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
    Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
    public support and donations to carry out its mission of
    increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
    freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
    array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
    ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
    status with the IRS.
  </div>

  <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
    The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
    charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
    States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
    considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
    with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
    where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
    DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
    visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
  </div>

  <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
    While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
    have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
    against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
    approach us with offers to donate.
  </div>

  <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
    International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
    any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
    outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
  </div>

  <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
    Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
    methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
    ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
    donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

    Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
  </div>

  <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
    Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
    Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
    freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
    distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
    volunteer support.
  </div>

  <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
    Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
    editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
    the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
    necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
    edition.
  </div>

  <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
    Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
    facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
  </div>

  <div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
    This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
    including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
    Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
