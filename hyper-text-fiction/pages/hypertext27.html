<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">A <span class="smcap">certain</span> mysterious charm clings to the
Spanish people, by reason of the long domain
of more than seven hundred years of the Moors over
the Peninsula, and consequent intermingling, to
some degree, of race, and considerable Oriental
influence on the national life and characteristics.
The chief sport of the Spaniards, the bull-fight, is
of Moorish origin; their popular dances and songs
raise recollections of Indian Nautch-girls and the
choruses in Moroccan coffee-houses; their predominant
sentiment, the jealousy over their women,
points back to the strict seclusion of the harem.
To divert to another paramount influence, Spain, to
this day the most Catholic country in the world, is
in history of awful interest as the country in which
the dread Inquisition took root most firmly: here
alone 32,000 persons were condemned to the <i lang="it">auto-da-fe</i>!
Gloominess, pride, and reserve have for
centuries been the reputed qualities of the
Spaniards. Oriental races are not mirthful; it is
difficult to make the dignified Moor smile, much
less laugh: the influence of the Moor, therefore,
and the absolute power of the Church as little,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</span>
could scarcely be conducive to merriment. And yet
Spanish literature is illumined throughout with bright
flashes of humour, like the silver lining to the dark
cloud of the history of the people—a humour which
shows itself in almost every phase of the national
literature, from the twelfth to the nineteenth
century: from incidents in the “Poema del Cid”
which tickled the rough sense of humour of the
warriors of the Middle Ages, to the delicate and
subtle irony of Valera in “Pepita Jimenez”—quaint
and naïve in the ballads and collections of
tales, sprightly in the drama, boisterous in the
“Novela Picaresca,” inimitable in “Don Quixote.”
A humour, moreover, not laboured, not purely
literary (though the latter kind is not lacking),
but spontaneous, and embodying the salient features
of the national life and characteristics.</p>
<p>It is both unnecessary and invidious to descant
upon “Don Quixote,” <i lang="fr">par excellence</i> the work of
Spanish Humour. The death-blow to the chivalrous
literature throughout civilised Europe (in Spain
more rankly luxuriant than elsewhere, and where
it perhaps reached its climax of absurdity), this
marvellous work spread rapidly from land to land,
and was first put into English in the year 1612. It
is here given from the latest and most scholarly translation,
the labour of love for eighteen years of Mr.
H. E. Watts. It may be as well, however, to draw
attention to the special phase of Spanish life round
which Spanish humour collected in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries—namely, the life of rogues
in the “Novela Picaresca”—to which a section of this
volume has been devoted, and the influence of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</span>
is traceable in other authors (such as Guevara and
Santos) not included in that section. This peculiar
taste, called El Gusto Picaresco (<i lang="es">pícaro</i> = rogue) owes
its origin, according to Ticknor, to the condition of
certain portions of society in the reigns of Charles V.
and Philip II., and it has ever been in popular
favour. Le Sage boldly imitated it in his famous
“Gil Blas”;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_1" id="FNanchor_1">[1]</a> and Fielding, Smollet, and other
English authors show its influence upon English
literature. This typical rogue, who generally starts
in life as a servant, has his counterpart on the stage
in the Gracioso (the valet), prototype of the Barbier
de Seville of Beaumarchais, and Molière's Scapin.</p>
<p>As this collection is not intended to be comprehensive,
no apology need be made for omissions
obvious perhaps to Spanish scholars. Among other
works, such as those of the Archpriest of Hita, of
Castillejo, Forner, Pitillas, and Moratin, the “Gatomaquia”
(<i>see</i> Notes) and “Mosquea,” burlesque epics
after the pattern of the “Batrachomyomachia,” are
not represented; nor yet the famous “Murciliego
Alevoso” (in which is displayed a humour not unlike
Pop) of Gonzalez, and the celebrated periodical
<i lang="es">El Padre Cobos</i>.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_2" id="FNanchor_2">[2]</a> That the drama, however, the
richest in Europe, and original and characteristic
as only either the Greek or the English drama,
should be so little represented is due to the fact
that the fun of a Spanish comedy generally lies
in the plot and in comic situations.</p>
<p>With regard to the tales and anecdotes (both
ancient and modern), the difficulty is any certainty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</span>
of their origin, though this applies to the literature
of all countries. The story of the cook and the
crane is a common chestnut (with us the crane is
a goose), the travellers’ tale of the huge cauldron
and the cabbage is perhaps too familiar to please;
but they are here of interest as from Spanish Tablebooks
of so long ago as the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>To come to the nineteenth century, our English
periodical essayists of the eighteenth—Addison,
Steele, and Johnson—will be recognised as prototypes
of Figaro, El Curioso Parlante, El Solitario,
&amp;c. These Spanish <i>Tatlers</i> and <i>Spectators</i> are, however,
on the whole, no servile imitators, and are
justly held in high esteem by the Spaniards, though
little known outside the Peninsula.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_3" id="FNanchor_3">[3]</a> The nineteenth-century
novel, in which critics see the continuity
of the Spanish genius, is here well represented by
Valer “Pepita Jiménez,” and “Sister Saint
Sulpice” of Valdés; other novelists, the rightly
popular Alarcon, and the distinguished authoress,
Emilia Pardo Bazan, have contributed short tales.</p>
<p>The chronological order, which on the whole is
adhered to down to the eighteenth century, is somewhat
neglected in the nineteenth for the sake of
variety and harmony in the arrangement of the
selections. It is also to be feared that a few names
of minor importance have crept in among the
authors of the present century.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</span></p>
<p>This compilation is based upon Ticknor’s great
work upon Spanish literature<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_4" id="FNanchor_4">[4]</a> and Padre Blanco
Garcia’s “History of the Literature of the Nineteenth
Century” (published 1891), besides some
valuable advice, generously given under great stress
of work and worry, by Senõr Don Rubió y Lluch,
professor of Spanish Literature to the University of
Barcelona. Other authorities consulted, biographies,
&amp;c., are too numerous to detail.</p>
<p>Existing translations have been used, and the
translators’ names appended. Among these many
famous ones from Elizabethan to modern times
will be noticed. Many of the selections have
been considerably adapted for various reasons,
principally to suit the requirements of a work intended
to be popular. Others are almost literal.
In many cases it has been no little difficulty to
select passages comprehensive enough to dispense
with explanations or a long introductory notice.</p>
<p>On the whole liveliness and attractiveness
(whether with success or no) is aimed at rather
than scholarly exactness, though it is to be hoped
the collection will also be of interest to the student,
and give a faithful reflection of Spanish humour so
far as possible in a foreign garb.</p>
<p>With regard to the insertion of extracts from
‪‬‬‬‬‬translations or Spanish originals published within
the last ten years, I have to thank the Cassell
Publishing Co., New York, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span> “The Account
Book,” translated by Mary J. Serrano; Messrs.
Thomas J. Crowell &amp; Co., New York, for the extracts
from “Sister Saint Sulpice,” translated by N. H.
Dole; Mr. Heinemann, for his kind permission to
insert the given extract from the translation of
“Pepita Jiménez”; Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench,
Trübner, and Co. for permission to insert the ballad
from Mr. Gibson’s Spanish Romances; Señora Doña
Emilia Pardo Bazan for her gracious permission
to select from her tales; Mr. H. E. Watts for permission
to insert extracts from his translation of
“Don Quixote.”</p>
<p>Finally, my best thanks are due to kind friends in
Catalonia (possessors in the Catalan of a distinct
tongue and valuable literature, if less important
than the Castilian) for their great help during my
residence at Barcelona by the furthering of my
Spanish studies, privately, and at the University.
While I owe much, to cultured Spaniards, from
Santander to Seville, for valuable information on
their national life and customs, and to my Mother,
a patient and enthusiastic traveller, and the origin,
in more than one way, of my sojourn and travels in
Spain.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_COWARDICE_OF_THE_INFANTES"> <i>THE COWARDICE OF THE INFANTES OF
CARRION WHEN THE LION BREAKS LOOSE.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">TWO years after their marriage did the Infantes of
Carrion sojourn in Valencia in peace and pleasure,
to their own great contentment, and their uncle Suero
Gonzalez with them; and at the end of those two years
there came to pass a great misadventure, by reason of
which they fell out with the Cid, in whom there was no
fault. There was a lion in the house of the Cid who had
grown a large one, and a strong, and was full nimble; three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
men had the keeping of this lion, and they kept him in a
den which was in a courtyard, high up in the palace; and
when they cleansed the court they were wont to shut him
up in his den, and afterward to open the door that he
might come out and eat: the Cid kept him for his pastime,
that he might take pleasure with him when he was minded
so to do. Now it was the custom of the Cid to dine every
day with his company, and after he had dined he was wont
to sleep awhile upon his seat. And one day when he had
dined there came a man and told him that a great fleet was
arrived in the port of Valencia, wherein there was a great
power of the Moors, whom King Bucar had brought over,
the son of the Miramamolin of Morocco. And when the
Cid heard this his heart rejoiced and he was glad, for
it was nigh three years since he had had a battle with
the Moors. Incontinently he ordered a signal to be made
that all the honourable men who were in the city should
assemble together. And when they were all assembled
in the Alcazar, and his sons-in-law with them, the Cid
told them the news, and took counsel with them in what
manner they should go out against this great power of
the Moors. And when they had taken counsel the Cid
went to sleep upon his seat, and the Infantes and the
others sat playing at tables and chess. Now at this time
the men who were keepers of the lion were cleaning the
court, and when they heard the cry that the Moors were
coming, they opened the den, and came down into the
palace where the Cid was, and left the door of the court
open. And when the lion had ate his meat and saw that
the door was open he went out of the court and came down
into the palace, even into the hall where they all were; and
when they who were there saw him, there was a great stir
among them; but the Infantes of Carrion showed greater
cowardice than all the rest. Ferrando Gonzalez having no
shame, neither for the Cid nor for the others who were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
present, crept under the seat whereon the Cid was sleeping,
and in his haste he burst his mantle and his doublet also at
the shoulders. And Diego Gonzalez, the other, ran to
a postern door, crying, “I shall never see Carrion again!”
This door opened upon a courtyard where there was a winepress,
and he jumped out, and by reason of the great
height could not keep on his feet, but fell among the
lees and defiled himself therewith. And all the others
who were in the hall wrapped their cloaks around their
arms, and stood round about the seat whereon the Cid
was sleeping, that they might defend him. The noise
which they made awakened the Cid, and he saw the lion
coming towards him, and he lifted up his hand and said,
“What is this?”... And the lion, hearing his voice,
stood still; and he rose up and took him by the mane
as if he had been a gentle mastiff, and led him back to
the court where he was before, and ordered his keepers
to look better to him for the time to come. And when he
had done this he returned to the hall and took his seat
again; and all they who beheld it were greatly astonished.</p>
<p>After some time, Ferrando Gonzalez crept from under
the seat where he had hidden himself, and he came out
with a pale face, not having yet lost his fear, and his
brother Diego got from among the lees: and when they
who were present saw them in this plight you never saw
such sport as they made; but my Cid forbade their
laughter. And Diego went out to wash himself and
change his garments, and he sent to call his brother
forth, and they took counsel together in secret.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">IN a certain convent there was a cat which had killed all
the mice in the convent but one, which was very big,
which she could not catch. The cat mused in her heart
in what manner she might deceive the mouse that she
might kill him; and thought so long till she agreed she must
take the veil, and clothe herself in nun’s garb, and sit
amongst the nuns at table, and then she might get at
the mouse; and she did as she had thought. The mouse,
when he saw the cat eating with the nuns, rejoiced greatly,
and thought, since the cat had become religious, that she
would henceforth do him no harm, insomuch that Don
Mouse came near to where the nuns were eating, and began
to leap about here and there. Then the cat rolled her eyes
as one who has no longer eyes for any vanity or folly, and
she kept a peaceful and humble countenance; and the
mouse, seeing that, drew near little by little; and when
the cat saw him nigh her she sprang upon him with her
claws and began to throttle him. And the mouse said,
“How is it that thou, a nun, art so cruel as to wish to
kill me?” Whereupon the cat replied, “Think not thy
cries will cause me to free thee; for know, brother, that
when it pleases me I am a nun, and when it pleases
me a canoness.”<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_5" id="FNanchor_5">[5]</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap">NOW it chanced that a good man kept some baths,
and a neighbour, a madman, was the first to come
daily to this bath; afterwards awaiting the arrival of the
people to bathe, he commenced, as soon as he saw them,
to beat them with sticks or throw stones at them, so that the
proprietor of the baths soon lost all his customers. The
good man, seeing this, determined to rise very early one
day, undressed himself, and went into the bath before the
madman arrived, having at hand a pail full of very hot
water and a wooden club. When the madman came to the
bath, determined, as usual, to attack all who came in his
way, the good man, seeing him enter, allowed him to
approach, when he suddenly upset the pail of hot water
over his head, attacking him at the same time with the
club. The madman now gave himself up for dead; nevertheless,
he managed to escape, and, running away, he told
every one he met to be careful, for there was a madman in
the bath.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THREE impostors came to a king and told him they
were cloth-weavers, and could fabricate a cloth of so
peculiar a nature that a legitimate son of his father could
see the cloth; but if he were illegitimate, though believed
to be legitimate, he could not see it.</p>
<p>Now the King was much pleased at this, thinking that
by this means he would be able to distinguish the men in
his kingdom who were legitimate sons of their supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
father’s from those who were not, and so be enabled to
increase his treasures, for among the Moors only legitimate
children inherit their father’s property; and for this
end he ordered a palace to be appropriated to the manufacture
of this cloth. And these men, in order to convince
him that they had no intention of deceiving him, agreed to
be shut up in this palace until the cloth was manufactured,
which satisfied the King.</p>
<p>When they were supplied with a large quantity of gold,
silver, silk, and many other things, they entered the palace,
and, putting their looms in order, gave it to be understood
that they were working all day at the cloth.</p>
<p>After some days, one of them came to the King and
told him the cloth was commenced, that it was the most
curious thing in the world, describing the design and
construction; he then prayed the King to favour them with
a visit, but begged he would come alone. The King was
much pleased, but wishing to have the opinion of some one
first, sent the Lord Chamberlain to see it, in order to know
if they were deceiving him. When the Lord Chamberlain
saw the workmen, and heard all they had to say, he dared
not admit he could not see the cloth, and when he returned
to the King he stated that he had seen it; the King sent
yet another, who gave the same report. When they whom
he had sent declared that they had seen the cloth, he
determined to go himself.</p>
<p>On entering the palace and seeing the men at work,
who began to describe the texture and relate the origin of
the invention, as also the design and colour, in which they
all appeared to agree, although in reality they were not
working; when the King saw how they appeared to work,
and heard the character of the cloth so minutely described,
and yet could not see it, although those he had sent had
seen it, he began to feel very uneasy, fearing he might not
be the son of the King who was supposed to be his father,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
and that if he acknowledged he could not see the cloth he
might lose his kingdom; under this impression he commenced
praising the fabric, describing its peculiarities after
the manner of the workmen.</p>
<div class="figcenter illowp80" style="max-width: 81.875em;" id="illus-b013">

<div class="caption"> “HE MOUNTED ON HORSEBACK AND RODE INTO THE CITY.”</div>
</div>
<p>On the return to his palace he related to his people
how good and marvellous was the cloth, yet at the same
time suspected something wrong.</p>
<p>At the end of two or three days the King requested his
“Alguacil” (or officer of justice) to go and see the cloth.
When the Alguacil entered and saw the workmen, who, as
before, described the figures and pattern of the cloth,
knowing that the King had been to see it, and yet could
not see it himself, he thought he certainly could not be the
legitimate son of his father, and therefore could not see it.
He, however, feared if he was to declare that he could not
see it he would lose his honourable position; to avoid this
mischance he commenced praising the cloth even more
vehemently than the others.</p>
<p>When the Alguacil returned to the King and told him
that he had seen the cloth, and that it was the most extraordinary
production in the world, the King was much
disconcerted; for he thought that if the Alguacil had seen
the cloth, which he was unable to see, there could no
longer be a doubt that he was not the legitimate son of
the King, as was generally supposed; he therefore did not
hesitate to praise the excellency of the cloth and the skill
of the workmen who were able to make it.</p>
<p>On another day he sent one of his Councillors, and it
happened to him as to the King and the others of whom I
have spoken; and in this manner, and for this reason, they
deceived the King and many others, for no one dared to
say he could not see the cloth.</p>
<p>Things went on thus until there came a great feast,
when all requested the King to be dressed in some of the
cloth; so the workmen, being ordered, brought some rolled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
up in a very fine linen, and inquired of the King how much
of it he wished them to cut off; so the King gave orders
how much and how to make it up.</p>
<p>Now when the clothes were made, and the feast day
had arrived, the weavers brought them to the King, informing
his Majesty that his dress was made of the cloth as he
had directed, the King all this time not daring to say he
could not see it.</p>
<p>When the King had professed to dress himself in this
suit, he mounted on horseback and rode into the city; but
fortunately for him it was summer time. The people seeing
his Majesty come in this manner were much surprised;
but knowing that those who could not see this cloth would
be considered illegitimate sons of their fathers, kept their
surprise to themselves, fearing the dishonour consequent
upon such a declaration. Not so, however, with a negro,
who happened to notice the King thus equipped; for he,
having nothing to lose, came to him and said, “Sire, to me
it matters not whose son I am, therefore I tell you that
you are riding without any clothes.” On this the King
commenced beating him, saying that he was not the legitimate
son of his supposed father, and therefore it was that
he could not see the cloth. But no sooner had the negro
said this, than others were convinced of its truth, and said
the same; until, at last, the King and all with him lost
their fear of declaring the truth, and saw through the trick
of which these impostors had made them the victims.
When the weavers were sought for they were found to have
fled, taking with them all they had received from the King
by their imposition.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THE King Abit, of Seville, was married to Romaquia,
and he loved her better than anything in the world.
She was a very virtuous woman, and the Moors recount
many of her good acts. But in one thing she did not
display much wisdom; this was that she generally had
some caprice or other which the King was always willing
to gratify.</p>
<p>One day, being in Cordova during the month of
February, there happened to be (which was very unusual)
a very heavy fall of snow. When Romaquia saw
this she began to weep. The King, seeing her so afflicted,
desired to know the cause of her grief.</p>
<p>“I weep,” said she, “because I am not permitted to
live in a country where we sometimes see snow.”</p>
<p>The King, anxious to gratify her, ordered almond-trees
to be planted on all the mountains surrounding Cordova,
for, it being a very warm climate, snow is seldom or never
seen there. But now, once a year, and that in the month
of February, the almond-trees came forth in full blossom,
which, from their whiteness, made it appear as if there had
been a fall of snow on the mountains, and was a source of
great delight to the Queen for a time.</p>
<p>On another occasion Romaquia, being in her apartment,
which overlooked the river, saw a woman without
shoes or stockings kneading mud on the banks of the river
for the purpose of making bricks. When Romaquia saw
this she began to cry, which the King observing, begged to
know the cause of her grief.</p>
<p>She replied, “It is because I am not free to do as I
please; I cannot do as yonder woman is doing.”</p>
<p>Then the King, in order to gratify her, ordered a lake
at Cordova to be filled with rose-water in place of ordinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
water, and to produce mud he had this filled with sugar,
powdered cinnamon and ginger, beautiful stones, amber,
musk, and as many other fragrant spices and perfumes as
could be procured, and in place of straws he ordered to be
placed ready small sugar-canes. Now when this lake was
full of such mud, as you may imagine, the King informed
Romaquia that now she might take off her shoes and
stockings and enjoy herself by making as many bricks as
she pleased.</p>

<div class="caption">“THE KING ORDERED A LAKE AT CORDOVA TO BE FILLED WITH ROSE-WATER.”</div>
</div>
<p>Another day, taking a fancy for something not immediately
procurable, she began weeping as before. The
King again entreated to know the cause of her grief.</p>
<p>“How can I refrain from tears,” said she, “when you
never do anything to please me?”</p>
<p>The King, seeing that so much had been done to
please and gratify her caprices, and feeling now at his wits’
end, exclaimed, in Arabic, “<i lang="ar">Ehu alenahac aten</i>,” which
means, “Not even the day of the mud.” That is to say,
that, although all the rest had been forgotten, she might
at least have remembered the mud he had prepared to
humour her.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">THERE lived in a city a Moor who was much respected,
and who had a son, the most promising
youth in the world, but not being rich enough to accomplish
the great deeds which he felt in his heart equal to, he
was greatly troubled, having the will and not the power.
Now in the same town there lived another Moor who held
a higher position, and was very much richer than his father,
and who had an only daughter, the very reverse in character<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
and appearance of the young man, she being of so
very violent a temper that no one could be found willing to
marry such a virago. One day the young man came to his
father and said, “You know that your means will not allow
you to put me in a position to live honourably,” adding
that, as he desired to live an easy and quiet life, he
thought it better to seek to enrich himself by an advantageous
marriage, or to leave that part of the country.
The father told him that he would be very happy if he
could succeed in such a union. On this the son proposed,
if it were agreeable to his father, to seek the daughter of
their neighbour in marriage. Hearing this, the father was
much astonished, and asked how he could think of such a
thing when he knew that no man, however poor, could be
induced to marry her.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the son insisted, and although the father
thought it a strange whim, in the end he gave his consent.
The good man then visited his neighbour telling him the
wish of his son.</p>
<p>When the good man heard what his friend said, he
answered, “By heaven, my friend, were I to do such a
thing I should prove myself a very false friend, for you
have a worthy son, and it would be base in me to consent
to his injury or death, and I know for certain that, were he
to live with my daughter, he would soon die, or death, at
least, would be preferable to life. Do not think I say this
from any objection to your alliance, for I should only be
too grateful to any man who would take her out of my
house.”</p>
<p>The young man’s father was much pleased at this, as
his son was so intent on the marriage. All being ultimately
arranged, they were in the end married, and the
bride taken home, according to the Moorish fashion, to
the house of her husband, and left to supper, the friends
and relations returning to their respective homes, waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
anxiously for the following day, when they feared to find
the bridegroom either dead or seriously injured.</p>
<p>Now, being left alone, the young couple sat down to
supper, when the bridegroom, looking behind him, saw his
mastiff, and said to him, “Bring me water wherewith to
wash my hands.” The dog naturally taking no notice of
this command, the young man became irritated, and ordered
the animal more angrily to bring him water for his hands,
which the latter not heeding, the young man arose in a
great rage, and, drawing his sword, commenced a savage
attack on the dog, who to avoid him ran away, but finding
no retreat jumped on the table, then to the fireplace, his
master still pursuing him, who, having caught him, first cut
off his head, then his paws, hewing him to pieces, covering
everything with blood. Thus furious and blood-stained
he returned to the table, and looking round saw a cat.
“Bring me water for my hands,” said he to him. The
animal not noticing the command, the master cried out,
“How, false traitor, did you not see how I treated the
mastiff for disobeying me? If you do not do as I tell
you this instant you shall share his fate.” The poor little
harmless cat continuing motionless, the master seized him
by the paws and dashed him to pieces against the wall.
His fury increasing, he again placed himself at the table,
looking about on all sides as if for something to attack next.
His wife, seeing this, and supposing he had lost his senses,
held her peace. At length he espied his horse, the only
one he had, and called to him fiercely to bring him water
to wash his hands. The animal not obeying he cried out
in a rage, “How is this? Think you that because you are
the only horse I have, you may dare thus to disobey my
orders? Know, then, that your fate shall be the same as
the others, and that any one living who dares to disobey me
shall not escape my vengeance.” Saying this he seized the
horse, cut off his head, and hacked him to pieces.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>
<p>And when the wife saw this, and knowing he had no
other horse, felt that he was really in earnest, she became
dreadfully alarmed.</p>
<p>He again sat down to table, raging and all bloody as he
was, swearing he would kill a thousand horses, or even men
or women, if they dared to disobey him. Holding at the
same time his bloody sword in his hand, he looked around
with glaring eyes until, fixing them on his wife, he ordered
her to bring him water to wash his hands.</p>
<p>The wife, expecting no other fate than to be cut to pieces
if she demurred, immediately arose and brought him the
water.</p>
<p>“Ha! thank God you have done so!” said he, “otherwise,
I am so irritated by these senseless brutes, that I should
have done by you as by them.” He afterwards commanded
her to help him to meat. She complied; but he told her,
in a fearful tone of voice, to beware, as he felt as if he was
going mad. Thus passed the night, she not daring to
speak, but strictly obeying all his orders. After letting her
sleep for a short time he said to her, “Get up; I have been
so annoyed that I cannot sleep, take care that nothing
disturbs me, and in the meanwhile prepare me a good and
substantial meal.”</p>
<p>While it was yet early the following morning the fathers,
mothers, and other relatives came stealthily to the door of
the young people, and, hearing no movement, feared the
bridegroom was either dead or wounded, and seeing the
bride approach the door alone were still more alarmed.</p>
<p>She, seeing them, went cautiously and tremblingly
towards them, and exclaimed: “Traitors, what are you
doing? How dare you approach this gate? Speak not—be
silent, or all of us, you as well as I, are dead.”</p>
<p>When they heard this they were much astonished, and
on learning what had taken place the night previous they
esteemed the young man very much who had made so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
good a commencement in the management of his household;
and from that day forward his wife became tractable
and complaisant, so that they led a very happy life. A
few days later his father-in-law, wishing to follow the
example of his son, likewise killed a horse in order to
intimidate his wife, but she said to him, “My friend, it is
too late to begin now; it would not avail you to kill a
hundred horses: we know each other too well.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">TWO townsmen and a countryman, on a pilgrimage to
Mecca, agreed to share provisions till they should
reach Mecca. But the victuals ran short, so that they had
nothing left but a little flour—enough to make a loaf. And
the townsmen, seeing that, said one to the other: “We
have but little food, and our companion eats much, how
shall we bring about that he shall eat none of the bread,
and that we alone eat it?” And they took this counsel—they
would make the loaf, and whilst it was baking should
all go to sleep, and whoever dreamed the most marvellous
thing in that time, he should alone eat the bread. This
they did, thinking to betray the simple rustic, and they
made the loaf and put it to bake, and then lay down to
sleep. But the rustic saw through their treachery, and
when the companions were sleeping took the half-baked
bread, ate it, and turned to sleep. Then one of the townsmen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
awoke as one dreaming and afraid, and called to his
companion; and the other said, “What hast thou?”</p>
<p>“I saw a marvellous vision: methought two angels
opened the gates of heaven, and bore me before the face
of God.”</p>
<p>And his companion said, “Marvellous is that vision.
But I dreamed that two angels seized me, and, cleaving
the earth, bore me to hell.”</p>
<p>The rustic heard all this and pretended to sleep, but the
others called out to him to awake, and he discreetly, as one
amazed, replied, “Who are ye that are calling me?”</p>
<p>They replied, “We are thy companions.”</p>
<p>And he said, “Have ye returned?”</p>

<p><i>Calisto.</i> Sempronio, Sempronio, why Sempronio, I say,
Where is this accursed Varlet?</p>
<p><i>Sempronio.</i> I am heere, Sir, about your horses.</p>
<p><i>Calisto.</i> My horses (you knave), how haps it then that
thou comst out of the hall?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>
<p><i>Sempronio.</i> The Gyrfalcon bated, and I came in to set
him on the Pearch.</p>
<p><i>Calisto.</i> Is’t e’en so? Now the divell take thee; misfortune
waite on thy heeles to thy destruction; mischiefe
light upon thee; let some perpetuall intolerable torment
seyze upon thee in so high a degree that it may be
beyond all comparison, till it bring thee (which shortly I
hope to see) to a most painfull, miserable, and disastrous
death. Goe, thou unlucky rogue, goe I say, and open the
chamber doore, and make ready my bed.</p>
<p><i>Sempronio.</i> Presently, Sir, the bed is ready for you.</p>
<p><i>Calisto.</i> Shut the windowes, and leave darknesse to
accompany him, whose sad thoughts deserve no light. Oh
death! how welcome art thou, to those who out-live their
happinesse! how welcome, wouldst thou but come when
thou art cal! O that Hypocrates and Galen, those
learned Physicians, were now living, and both heere, and
felt my paine! O heavens! if yee have any pitty in you,
inspire that Pleberian heart therewith, lest that my soule,
helplesse of hope, should fall into the like misfortune with
Pyrramus and Thisbe.</p>
<p><i>Sempronio.</i> What a thing is this? Wha the matter
with you?</p>
<p><i>Calisto.</i> Away, get thee gone, doe not speake to me,
unlesse thou wilt, that these my hands, before thy time be
come, cut off thy daies by speedy death.</p>
<p><i>Sempronio.</i> Since you will lament all alone, and have
none to share with you in your sorrowes, I will be gone,
Sir.</p>
<p><i>Calisto.</i> Now the divell goe with thee.</p>
<p><i>Sempronio.</i> With me Sir? There is no reason that he
should goe with me, who stayes with you. O unfortunate,
O sudden and unexpected ill; what contrarious accident,
what squint-ey’d starre is it that hath robbed this Gentleman
of his wonted mirth? and not of that alone, but of it (which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
is worse) his wits. Shall I leave him all alone? or shall I
goe in to him? If I leave him alone, he will kill himselfe.
If I goe in, he will kill me. Let him bide alone, and bite
upon the bit, come what will come, I care not. Better it is
that hee dye, whose life is hatefull unto him, than that I
dye, when life is pleasing unto mee, and say that I should
not desire to live, save only to see my Elicia, that alone is
motive inoughe to make mee louke to my selfe, and guard
my person from dangers.... Well, I will let him alone
awhile, and give his humour leave to work out it selfe; ...
againe, if he see me in sight, I shall see him more incensed
against me: For there the sun scorcheth most where he
reflecteth most.... And therefore I think it my best play,
to play least in sight, and to stay a little longer; but if in
the meanewhile he should kill him selfe, then farewell he.
Perhaps I may get more by it than every man is aware of,
and cast my skinne, changing rags for robes, and penury
for plenty. But it is an old saying, He that lookes after
dead-men’s shoes, may chance to goe barefoote: Perhaps
also the divell hath deceived me. And so his death may
be my death, and then all the fat is in the fire: The rope
will go after the Bucket: and one losse follows another;—on
the other side, your wise men say, That it is a great ease
to a grieved soule to have a companion, to whom he may
communicate his sorrow. Besides, it is generally received,
that the wound which bleedes inward, is ever the more
dangerous. Why then in these two extremes hang I in
suspense. What I were best to doe? Sure the safest is to
enter....</p>
<p><i>Calisto.</i> Sempronio!</p>

<p><i>Sempronio.</i> This Lute, Sir, is out of tune.</p>
<p><i>Calisto.</i> How shall he tune it, who himselfe is out of
tune?... Or how can he do anything well, whose will is
not obedient to reason? who harbors in his brest needles,
peace, warre, truce, love, hate, injuries and suspicions; and
all these at once, and from one and the same cause. Doe
thou therefore take this Lute unto thee, and sing me the
most doleful ditty thou canst devise.</p>

shot all his arrowes only against him. O Cupid, how high
and unsearchable are thy mysteries! What reward has
thou ordained for love, since that so necessary a tribulation
attends on lovers? That hast set his bounds, as markes for

<p><i>Leno.</i> Ah, Troico, are you there?</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> Yes, my good fellow, do you see I am?</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> It would be better if I did not see it.</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> Why so, Leno?</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> Why, then you would not know a piece of ill-luck
that has just happened.</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> What ill-luck?</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> What day is it to-day?</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> Thursday.</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> Thursday? How soon will Friday come, then?</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> Friday will come to-morrow.</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> Well, tha something;—but tell me, are there
not other days of ill-luck as well as Fridays?</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> Why do you ask?</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> Because there may be unlucky pancakes, if there
are unlucky Thursdays.</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> I suppose so.</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> Now, stop there;—suppose one of yours had been
eaten of a Thursday, on whom would the ill-luck have
fallen—on the pancake, or on you?</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> On me, of course.</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> Then, my good Troico, comfort yourself, and
begin to suffer and be patient; for men, as the saying is,
are born to misfortunes, and these are matters, in fine, that
come from God; and in the order of time you must die
yourself, and, as the saying is, your last hour will then be
come and arrived. Take it, then, patiently, and remember
that we are here to-morrow and gone to-day.</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> For heaven’s sake, Leno, is anybody in the family
dead? Or else why do you console me so?</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> Would to heaven that were all, Troico!</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> Then what is it? Can’t you tell me without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
so many circumlocutions? What is all this preamble
about?</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> When my poor mother died, he that brought me
the news, before he told me of it, dragged me round through
more turn-abouts than there are windings in the rivers
Pisuerga and Zapardiel.</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> But I have got no mother, and never knew one.
I don’t know what you mean.</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> Then smell this napkin.</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> Very well, I have smelt it.</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> What does it smell of?</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> Something like butter.</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> Then you may surely say, “Here Troy was.”</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> What do you mean, Leno?</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> For you it was given to me; for you Donna
Timbria sent it, all stuck over with nuts;—but, as I have
(and Heaven and everybody else knows it) a sort of natural
relationship for whatever is good, my eyes watched and
followed her just as a hawk follows chickens.</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> Followed whom, villain? Timbria?</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> Heaven forbid! But how nicely she sent it, all
made up with butter and sugar!</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> And what was that?</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> The pancake, to be sure,—don’t you understand?</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> And who sent a pancake to me?</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> Why, Donna Timbria.</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> Then what became of it?</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> It was consumed.</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> How?</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> By looking at it?</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> Who looked at it?</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> I, by ill-luck.</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> In what fashion?</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> Why, I sat down by the wayside.</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> Well, what next?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> I took it in my hand.</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> And then?</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> Then I tried how it tasted; and what between
taking and leaving all around the edges of it, when I tried
to think what had become of it, I found I had no sort of
recollection.</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> The upshot is that you ate it?</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> It is not impossible.</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> I’ faith you are a trusty fellow!</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> Indeed! do you think so? Hereafter, if I bring
two, I will eat them both, and so be better yet.</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> The business goes on well, truly!</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> And well advised, and at small cost, and to my
content. But now, go to; suppose we have a little jest
with Timbria.</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> Of what sort?</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> Suppose you make her believe you ate the pancake
yourself, and, when she thinks it is true, you and I can
laugh at the trick till you split your sides. Can you ask
for anything funnier?</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> You counsel well, indeed.</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> Well, Heaven bless the men that listen to reason!
But tell me, Troico, do you think you can carry out the jest
with a grave face?</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> I? What have I to laugh about?</p>
<p><i>Leno.</i> Why, don’t you think it is a laughing matter to
make her believe you ate it, when all the time it was your
own good Leno that did it?</p>
<p><i>Troico.</i> Wisely said! But now hold your tongue, and go
about your business!</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A <span class="smcap">rustic</span> desirous to see the King, thinking he was
more than man, put his wages in his pocket and
took leave of his master. But the pennies soon melted
away on the long journey to the capital. Having arrived
and seen the King, whom he found to be a man like himself,
he was so disgusted at having spent upon this all his
money excepting half a real, that a tooth began to ache, and
what with hunger tormenting him too he did not know what
to do, for he said to himself, “If I have the tooth drawn,
and give my half real for that, I shall die of hunger; while,
if I eat the half real, my tooth will go on aching.” As he
was thus debating he approached a pastrycook’s stall, and
gazed with longing eyes at the tarts displayed. By chance
two lackeys were passing by, who, seeing him so taken up
with the pastry, cried out, to make sport—</p>
<p>“Hola, rustic, how many tarts would you venture to
make a meal of?”</p>
<p>“By heavens! I could swallow fifty.”</p>
<p>“Go to the devil!” said they.</p>
<p>“Gentlemen,” he replied, “you are easily frightened.”</p>
<p>Upon which they offered to lay a wager.</p>
<p>“Done,” said the rustic; “if I don’t eat fifty, you can
draw this tooth,” and he pointed to the one that ached.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I <span class="smcap">am</span> sorry to say that I never met with so avaricious
and so wicked an old curmudgeon; he allowed me
almost to die daily of hunger, without troubling himself
about my necessities; and, to say the truth, if I had not
helped myself by means of a ready wit and nimble fingers,
I should have closed my account from sheer starvation.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all my master’s astuteness and cunning,
I contrived so to outwit him that generally the best half
came to my share. But to accomplish this I was obliged
to tax my powers of invention to the uttermost. The old
man was accustomed to carry his bread, meat, and other
things, in a sort of linen knapsack, which was closed at the
mouth with an iron ring, and secured also by a padlock;
but in adding to his store, or taking from it, he used such
vigilance that it was almost an impossibility to cheat him of
a single morsel. However, when he had given me my
pittance, which I found no difficulty in dispatching at
about two mouthfuls, and closed his budget, thinking
himself perfectly secure from depredation, I began my
tactics, and by means of a small rent, which I slyly effected
in one of the seams of the bag, I used to help myself to the
choicest pieces of meat, bacon, and sausage, taking care to
close the seam according as opportunity occurred. But in
addition to this, all that I could collect together, either by
fraud or otherwise, I carried about me in half farthings; so
that when the old man was sent for to pray, and they gave
him farthings (all which passed through my hands, he
being blind), I contrived to slip them into my mouth, by
which process so quick an alteration was effected that when
they reached his hands they were invariably reduced to half
the original value.</p>

been with me they give me nothing but half-farthings,
whereas before it was not an unusual thing to be paid with
halfpence, but never less than farthings. I must be sharp
with <i>you</i>, I find.” Whenever we ate, the old man took care
to keep a small jar of wine near him, which was reserved
for his own especial service, but I very soon adopted the
practice of bestowing on this favourite jar sundry loving
though stolen embraces. Such pleasures were but short-lived,
for the fervency of my attachment was soon discovered
in the deficiency of the wine; and the old man afterwards,
to secure his draught, never let the jar go without tying it
to him by the handle. But I was a match for him even
there; for I procured a long straw, and, dipping it into the
mouth of the jar, renewed my intimacy with such effect that
but a small share was his who came after me. The old
traitor was not long in finding me out; I think he must
have heard me drink, for he quickly changed his plan,
and placed the jar between his knees, keeping the mouth
closed with his hand, and in this manner considered
himself secure from my depredations.</p>

began to try them, while I assisted his endeavours with my
feeble prayers; when lo, and behold! when least I thought
it, the lid of the chest arose, and I almost fancied I beheld
the divine essence therein in the shape of loaves of bread.
“I have no money,” said I to my preserver, “but give me
the key and help yourself.” He took some of the whitest
and best bread he could find, and went away well pleased,
though not half so well as myself. I refrained from taking
any for the present, lest the deficiency might be noticed, and
contented myself with the hope that, on seeing so much in

the house for joy to think that my miserable life was about
to change, and for some days following I was as happy as a
king. But it was not predestined for me that such good
luck should continue long; on the third day symptoms of
my old complaint began to show themselves, for I beheld
my murderer in the act of examining our chest, turning and
counting the loaves over and over again. Of course I dissimulated
my terror, but it was not for want of my prayers
and invocations that he was not struck stone-blind like my
old master, but he retained his eyesight.</p>
<p>After he had been some time considering and counting,
he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span> “If I were not well assured of the security of this
chest, I should say that somebody had stolen my bread;
but, however, to remove all suspicion, from this day I shall
count the loaves; there remain now exactly nine and a
piece.”</p>
<p>“May nine curses light upon you, you miserable beggar,”
said I to myself, for his words went like an arrow to my
heart, and hunger already began to attack me, seeing a
return to my former scanty fare now inevitable.</p>
<p>No sooner did the priest go out than I opened the chest
to console myself even with the sight of food, and as I gazed
on the nice white loaves a sort of adoration arose within
me, which the sight of such tempting morsels could alone
inspire. I counted them carefully to see if, perchance, the
curmudgeon had mistaken the number; but, alas! I found
he was a much better reckoner than I could have desired.
The utmost I dared do was to bestow on these objects of
my affection a thousand kisses, and, in the most delicate
manner possible, to nibble here and there a morsel of the
crust. With this I passed the day, and not quite so jovially
as the former, you may suppose.</p>
<p>But as hunger increased, and more so in proportion as I
had fared better the few days previously, I was reduced to
the last extremity. Yet all I could do was to open and
shut the chest and contemplate the divine image within.
Providence, however, who does not neglect mortals in such
an extreme crisis, suggested to me a slight palliation of my
present distress. After some consideration, I said within
myself, “This chest is very large and old, and in some parts,
though very slightly, is broken. It is not impossible to
suppose that rats may have made an entrance and gnawed
the bread. To take a whole loaf would not be wise, seeing
that it would be missed by my most liberal master, but the
other plan he shall certainly have the benefit of.” Then I
began to pick the loaves on some tablecloths which were
there, not of the most costly sort, taking one loaf and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
leaving another, so that in the end I made up a tolerable
supply of crumbs, which I ate like so many sugar-plums;
and with that I in some measure consoled myself and
contrived to live.</p>
<p>The priest, when he came home to dinner and opened
the chest, beheld with dismay the havoc made in his store;
but he immediately supposed it to have been occasioned by
rats, so well had I imitated the style of those depredators.
He examined the chest narrowly, and discovered the little
holes through which the rats might have entered, and calling
me, he said, “Lazaro, look what havoc has been made in
our bread during the night.” I seemed very much astonished,
and asked “what it could possibly be?” “What
has done it?” quoth he; “why, rats; confound ‘em, there
is no keeping anything from them.” I fared well at dinner,
and had no reason to repent of the trick I played, for he
pared off all the places which he supposed the rats had
nibbled at, and, giving them to me, he said, “There, eat
that; rats are very clean animals.” In this manner, adding
what I thus gained to that acquired by the labour of my
hands, or rather my nails, I managed tolerably well, though
I little expected it. I was destined to receive another
shock when I beheld my miserable tormentor carefully
stopping up all the holes in the chest with small pieces of
wood, which he nailed over them, and which bade defiance
to further depredations. “Oh, Lord!” I cried involuntarily,
“to what distress and misfortunes are we unhappy
mortals reduced, and how short-lived are the pleasures of
this our transitory existence. No sooner did I draw some
little relief from the measure which kind fortune suggested,
than it is snatched away; and this last act is like closing
the door of consolation against me, and opening that of my
misfortunes.”</p>
<p>It was thus I gave vent to my distress, while the careful
workman, with abundance of wood and nails, was finishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
his cruel job, saying with great glee. “Now, you rascals of
rats, we will change sides, if you please, for your future
reception in this house will be right little welcome.”</p>
<p>The moment he left the house I went to examine his
work, and found he had not left a single hole unstopped by
which even a mosquito could enter. I opened the chest,
though without deriving the smallest benefit from its contents;
my key was now utterly useless; but as I gazed with
longing eyes on the two or three loaves which my master
believed to be bitten by the rats, I could not resist the
temptation of nibbling a morsel more, though touching
them in the lightest possible manner, like an experienced
swordsman in a friendly assault.</p>
<p>Necessity is a great master, and being in this strait, I
passed night and day in devising means to get out of it.
All the rascally plans that could enter the mind of man did
hunger suggest to me, for it is a saying, and a true one, as I
can testify, that hunger makes rogues, and abundance fools.
One night, when my master slept, of which disposition he
always gave sonorous testimony, as I was revolving in my
mind the best mode of renewing my intimacy with the contents
of the chest, a thought struck me, which I forthwith
put in execution. I arose very quietly, and, taking an old
knife which, having some little glimmering of the same idea
the day previous, I had left for an occasion of this nature, I
repaired to the chest, and at the part which I considered
least guarded I began to bore a hole. The antiquity of the
chest seconded my endeavours, for the wood had become
rotten from age, and easily yielded to the knife, so that in a
short time I managed to display a hole of very respectable
dimensions. I then opened the chest very gently, and,
taking out the bread, I treated it much in the same manner
as heretofore, and then returned safe to my mattress.</p>
<p>The next day my worthy master soon spied my handiwork,
as well as the deficiency in his bread, and began by wishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
the rats at the devil. “What can it mean?” said he;
“during all the time I have been here there have never
been rats in the house before.” And he might say so with
truth; if ever a house in the kingdom deserved to be free
from rats, it was his, as they are seldom known to visit
where there is nothing to eat. He began again with nails
and wood, but when night came, and he slept, I resumed
my operations, and rendered nugatory all his ingenuity.</p>
<p>In this manner we went on; the moment he shut one
door, I opened another; like the web of Penelope, what he
spun by day I unravelled by night, and in the course of a
few nights the old chest was so maltreated that little remained
of the original that was not covered with pieces and
nailing. When the unhappy priest found his mechanical
ability of no avail, he said, “Really, this chest is in such a
state, and the wood is so old and rotten, that the rats make
nothing of it. The best plan I can think of, since what we
have done is of no use, is to arm ourselves within against
these cursed rats.” He then borrowed a rat-trap, and baiting
it with bits of cheese which he begged from the neighbours,
set it under the chest. This was a piece of singular
good fortune for me, for although my hunger needed no
sauce, yet I did not nibble the bread at night with less
relish because I added thereto the bait from the rat-trap.
When in the morning he found not only the bread gone as
usual, but the bait likewise vanished, and the trap without
a tenant, he grew almost beside himself. He ran to the
neighbours and asked of them what animal it could possibly
be that could positively eat the very cheese out of the trap,
and yet escape untouched. The neighbours agreed that it
could be no rat that could thus eat the bait, and not remain
within the trap, and one more cunning than the rest observed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
“I remember once seeing a snake about your
premises, and depend on it that is the animal which has
done you this mischief, for it could easily pick the bait
from the trap without entering entirely, and thus too it
might easily escape.” The rest all agreed that such must
be the fact, which alarmed my master a good deal.</p>
<p>He now slept not near so soundly as before, and at every
little noise, thinking it was the snake biting the chest, he
would get up, and taking a cudgel which he kept at his
bed’s head for the purpose, began to belabour the poor
chest with all his might, so that the noise might frighten
the reptile from his unthrifty proceedings. He even awoke
the neighbours with such prodigious clamour, and I could
not get a single minute’s rest. He turned me out of bed,
and looked amongst the straw, and about the blanket, to
see if the creature was concealed anywhere; for, as he
observed, at night they seek warm places, and not unfrequently
injure people by biting them in bed. When he
came I always pretended to be very heavy with sleep, and
he would say to me in the morning, “Did you hear nothing
last night, boy? The snake was about, and I think I heard
him at your bed, for they are very cold creatures, and love
warmth.” “I hope to God he will not bite me,” returned
I, “for I am very much afraid.” He was so watchful at
night that, by my faith, the snake could not continue his
operations as usual, but in the morning, when the priest was
at church, he resumed them pretty steadily as usual.</p>
<p>Looking with dismay at the damage done to his store,
and the little redress he was likely to have for it, the poor
priest became quite uneasy from fretting, and wandered
about all night like a hobgoblin. I began very much to
fear that, during one of these fits of watchfulness, he might
discover my key, which I placed for security under the
straw of my bed. I therefore, with a caution peculiar to
my nature, determined in future to keep this treasure by
night safe in my mouth; and this was an ancient custom of
mine, for during the time I lived with the blind man my
mouth was my purse, in which I could retain ten or twelve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
maravedies in farthings, without the slightest inconvenience
in any way. Indeed, had I not possessed this faculty, I
should never have had a single farthing of my own, for I
had neither pocket nor bag that the old man did not continually
search. Every night I slept with the key in my
mouth without fear of discovery; but, alas! when misfortune
is our lot, ingenuity can be of little avail.</p>
<p>It was decreed, by my evil destiny, or rather, I ought to
say, as a punishment for my evil doings, that one night,
when I was fast asleep, my mouth being somewhat open,
the key became placed in such a position therein that my
breath came in contact with the hollow of the key, and
caused—the worst luck for me!—a loud whistling noise.
On this my watchful master pricked up his ears, and
thought it must be the hissing of the snake which had done
him all the damage, and certainly he was not altogether
wrong in his conjectures. He arose very quietly, with his
club in his hand, and stealing towards the place whence the
hissing sound proceeded, thinking at once to put an end
to his enemy, he lifted his club, and with all his force discharged
such a blow on my unfortunate head that it needed
not another to deprive me of all sense and motion. The
moment the blow was delivered he felt it was no snake that
had received it, and, guessing what he had done, called out
to me in a loud voice, endeavouring to recall me to my
senses. Then, touching me with his hands, he felt the
blood, which was by this time in great profusion about my
face, and ran quickly to procure a light. On his return he
found me moaning, yet still holding the key in my mouth,
and partly visible, being in the same situation which caused
the whistling noise he had mistaken for the snake. Without
thinking much of me, the attention of the slayer of snakes
was attracted by the appearance of the key, and drawing it
from my mouth, he soon discovered what it was, for of
course the wards were precisely similar to his own. He ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
to prove it, and with that at once found out the extent of
my ingenuity.</p>
<p>“Thank God,” exclaimed this cruel snake hunter, “that
the rats and the snakes which have so long made war upon
me, and devoured my substance, are both at last discovered.”</p>
<p>Of what passed for three days afterwards I can give no
account, but that which I have related I heard my master
recount to those who came there to see me. At the end,
however, of the third day I began to have some consciousness
of what was passing around me, and found myself
extended on my straw, my head bound up and covered with
ointment and plaisters.</p>
<p>“What is the meaning of all this?” I cried in extreme
alarm. The heartless priest replied, “I have only been
hunting the rats and the snakes, which have almost ruined
me.” Seeing the condition in which I was, I then guessed
what had happened to me. At this time an old nurse
entered, with some of the neighbours, who dressed the
wounds on my head, which had assumed a favourable
appearance; and as they found my senses were restored to
me, they anticipated but little danger, and began to amuse
themselves with my exploits, while I, unhappy sinner, could
only deplore their effects.</p>
<p>With all this, however, they gave me something to eat,
for I was almost dying with hunger, and at the end of
fourteen or fifteen days I was able to rise from my bed
without danger, though not even then without hunger, and
only half cured. The day after I got up my worthy and
truly respectable master took my hand, and, opening the
door, put me into the street, saying, “Lazaro, from this day
look out for yourself; seek another master, and fare you
well. No one will ever doubt that you have served a blind
man, but for me, I do not require so diligent nor so clever
a servant.” Then shaking me off, as though I was in league<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
with the Evil One, he went back into his house and shut
the door.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I<span class="smcap">t</span> was my hap one day to bear in my basket, which
I brought from the Shambles, a quarter of Mutton, for
a certain Hosier, or Gentleman Tailor. I had by chance at
that time about me, certain old Coplas, or Ballads, which in
a kind of broken tune still, as I read this or t’other line, I
fell a-singing, as I went along. My good Master having (as
it should seem) listened unto me, looked back on the
sudden, and smiling, said—</p>
<p>“How now, my tattered Rascal, a pox take you for a
ragga-muffin. Can you read, you Rogue?”</p>
<p>“Yes, marry, can I, Sir,” quoth I. “I thank God I can
read reasonable well, but my writing is better than my
reading.”</p>
<p>“Sayst thou so, Boy?”</p>
<p>And with that he entreated me, that I would teach him
to write his name, or to make some mark that might serve
for a subscription, or undersigning. He cared not which,
for either would serve his turn.</p>
<p>“I pray, Sir,” said I, “what good can this do you?
What can you benefit yourself, by having learnt to make
a bare mark and no more? Methinks you should have no
great use for that alone, unless you could write too.”</p>
<p>“Yes, marry, have I, Sir,” quoth he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span> “for I have much
work goes through these hands, of such and such great
men, I make all the clothes their children wear” (and
there, by the way, he reckons me up a beadroll of these
and these Lords) “and therefore I would very fain, if
I knew how, learn to write my Name, or to make my Mark,
that if occasion were offered I might not be taken for an
Ass, and say like a fool as I am when I am called to subscribe,
‘Indeed, Sir, you must pardon me, I cannot write.’”</p>
<p>And so this business broke off as abruptly, as it began.
And I making a large soliloquium, and meditation to
myself, went on.</p>

sort give four shillings; and the best seldom above a crown.)</p>
<p class="drop-cap">N<span class="smcap">ow</span> methought I saw Heaven opened, and my honest
Carrier appearing unto me in the shape of an Angel.
His face was as joyful unto me, as that of the desired
Physician is to him that is afflicted with sickness. I say,
desired; because (as perhaps you may have heard) a
Physician hath three faces: Of a man, when we see him,
and have no need of him: of an angel when we are sick,
and cannot be without him: and of a Devil, when at
one and the self-same time our sickness, and our purse
ends together, and yet for his private interest and to
gain a fee, he follows us with daily visits. As it happened
to a Gentleman in Madrid, who having sent for a physician,
for a certain infirmity, wherewithal he was troubled, every
visit that he made, gave him a crown. The humour ceased;
but his physician was not in the humour to cease from
coming unto him.</p>
<p>Now the Gentleman, when he saw that he was thorough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
well, and that his Physician did still continue his visits, he
got him up one morning very early and went to Church.</p>
<p>Now, when the Physician came to visit him, and found
him not at home, he asked his servant whither he was gone.
He (like a fool as he was), for there are Servants still
enow for their masters’ hurt, but few for their profit, told
him, that he was gone forth to Mass to such a Church. My
nimble Doctor, putting spurs to his Mule for to make
the more haste, went with all speed to the said Church,
and, searching for him, at last he found him; and then said
unto him—</p>
<p>“What in God’s name, Sir, do you mean to commit
so great an excess, as to go abroad without my leave?”</p>
<p>The Gentleman, who knew well enough what he came
for, and seeing that now he had no more need of him, put
his hand in his pocket, took out his purse, drew forth a
crown, and putting it in his hand, told him, “Here, take it,
master Doctor; for by the faith of a Gentleman, I now perceive
even this sacred place cannot privilege me from you.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">I<span class="smcap">n</span> the evenings we used to assemble, some ten or twelve
of us, and amused ourselves with discussing the different
kind of new exclamations we had hit upon, to rouse
public sympathy in our behalf. Such was the skill of a
few, that they had invented forms of benediction from
which they derived considerable profit by the sale of them
to other less ingenious heads than their own; so great was
their novelty and efficacy with all classes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>
<p>On every festival we went early in the morning to church,
where plenary indulgence was always granted us. We placed
ourselves in the most convenient stations; we continued
there the whole morning; and towards evening we issued
forth into the neighbouring villages, calling at the country
seats and farmhouses on our road. From these we usually
brought away some slices of bacon, bread and cheese, eggs,
and sometimes old clothes and other articles; so successfully
did we work upon the charity of the good people.
Did a person above the common rank happen to make his
appearance, we instantly united in setting up a loud lamentation,
even at a distance, giving him time to put his hand
into his pocket, and vociferating louder and louder the
nearer he came, so as to compel him in a manner to be
charitable.</p>
<p>If we met a number of good citizens together, and had
leisure to prepare to accost them in due form, each played
his own part—one the <i>blind</i>, another the <i>halt</i>, a third the
<i>dumb</i>, a fourth the <i>paralytic</i>, a fifth the <i>idiotic</i>, and some
with crutches, making altogether a complication of human
misery and distortion, which, with the most able at our
head, was sure to penetrate into the pockets even of the
callous. Could you but have heard the concord of sweet
sounds we made at the crisis that decided the balance
in our favour! We beseeched the Lord to bless them with
lovely children—to return their bounty a hundred fold—and
long to preserve their precious health. Not a party of
pleasure could be got up, not a single festival pass, but we
had some share in it; so that however much others expended
we gained by them; and so acute was our scent
that we could smell the preparation for them at an enormous
distance.</p>
<p>In the same way the mansions of the cardinals, the
bishops, and ambassadors, with all kind of open houses,
were successfully besieged and occupied by us. Thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
we might truly be said to possess all, levying as we did
a tax upon all, though really having nothing. I know
not how my comrades felt inclined on receiving charity
from the hands of a pretty lady; but for my part,
miserable sinner, when I accosted a young creature, enchanting
both in face and figure, I looked her steadily
in the face while I asked with my eyes fixed upon hers.
If she gave me anything, I caught her hand, pressed it
affectionately, and imprinted upon it a kiss in the fervour
of my gratitude, before she had time to withdraw it. Yet
so respectfully, or rather, hypocritically, was this done, that
the lady, not being previously alarmed, took the whole
in good part, as a transport of grateful joy.</p>
<p>What are called the pleasures of life—erroneously supposed
to be monopolised by the great and the wealthy
of this best of worlds—are, in fact, the chief property of
us mendicants, who feel no drawback, but taste their flavour
with a double relish, without a tithe of their anxiety and
trouble to obtain them. Had the happy fellows no other
privilege than that of asking freely, and receiving without
the least touch of shame or pain, it is such a one as the
rest of mankind cannot boast; if we only except monarchs
and their royal families, who, without a blush, can demand
what they please from their good people, while the sole
difference between them and other beggars is, that they
always wring out silver and gold even from the poorest
people, while we require nothing but a mere trifle from the
most proud and wealthy. There is no condition, therefore,
more happy and respectable than that of the mendicant,
but all do not know their own happiness—“beati si sua
bona norint.”</p>
<p>The most part of us—wholly sunk in the enjoyment of
mere animal life; insensible of the true pleasure of living
independently, free from strife, from all speculative losses,
all intrigues of State, eternal business; in short, from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
infernal embarrassment in which the great are involved—to
the day of their death have the folly to envy what they
ought to avoid. The first man who embraced our kind
of life must, from his very nature, have been much better
than the great—I mean a great philosopher.</p>
<p>I had been led to think that this noble fraternity was
safe from the usual shocks of fortune, but the malicious
goddess made them occasionally feel the effects of her
ire—throwing little stumbling-blocks in their way, much
like the one I broke my shins over, when on a visit
at Gaeta, whither I had gone out of curiosity, and in
the idea that a man already able in the profession would
only need to enter the town to feel a revivifying shower of
alms poured upon him from all sides. No sooner was I
there than, having assumed a new complexion, I placed
myself at the entrance into a church. As luck would have
it, the governor of the place was then passing, and, after
looking at me very earnestly for a few moments, he gave
me alms. A number of the natives immediately followed
his example, and it acted as a continued benediction for
me during more than a week; but there is a medium in
all things, and I did not observe the golden rule. On the
next festival, my complexion appearing no longer ingenious
enough, I changed it for a huge ulcer on my leg, and for
this purpose I put in practice one of the choicest secrets
of my craft.</p>
<p>After having put my leg into an elegant case, I took an
advantageous station at the entrance to a well-frequented
church. There, setting up a sorrowful howl, caused by the
new pain I felt from the ulcer, I caught the eye of almost
every one that passed. I thought I excited the compassion
of all who looked on me, but unluckily my rubicund complexion,
which I had neglected to sicken over with white,
seemed to give the lie to my lamentations, and might well
excite suspicion; but good people are not over suspicious,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
and I heard the golden shower dropping sweetly and plentifully
as they went into the house of prayer. In short, I got
more than all the rest of my brethren put together, and
they wished me at the devil, with my ulcer, that brought
the capital into one bank.</p>
<p>As the stars at last would have it, there came the governor
to hear mass at this very church—surely for my sins—and
he recognised my voice in a moment, surveying me intently
from head to foot. Yes, it was my voice, for elsewhere I
was impenetrable; my whole person being disguised in the
most effectual manner, with a huge napkin round my head,
reaching down to my nose. Alas! he was a man of strong
natural penetration, and suspicious as the devil; for, as
he fixed me with his eyes, he seemed to be saying within
himself, “For these several days past I have heard, I have
seen, this odd-looking fish; is it possible he has got so
dreadful an ulcer—all at once? Let us examine a little
farther.” “Friend,” he observed, “you seem in a sad
plight; your case truly deserves compassion; come, follow
me, I will at least give you a shirt to your back.”</p>
<p>I had the indiscretion to obey, for I suspected nothing.
Had I so done, spite of all the people at his heels, I vow I
would have given him the slip, and saved my unfortunate
carcase. He had no sooner got me safely housed than he
assumed a cold and severe aspect, from which I augured
nothing pleasant. He then asked me sharply if I were not
the person he had seen at the door of a church, with a complexion
as pale as death. I grew pale enough indeed at
this, and lost all presence of mind; I could not deny it:
and when he asked me how I had got so speedily cured
of my scalded head and other infirmities I was still more
puzzled than before. “Besides,” he continued, “I cannot
comprehend how, with that ruddy complexion of thine,
thou hast got such a terrible ulcer in the leg.” “My
lord,” replied I, quite disconcerted, and trembling in every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
limb, “I know not how it is, except that it is the will of
God.”</p>
<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="illus-b077">

<p>But what was my anxiety when I heard the governor
direct one of his messengers to go and call in a surgeon.
I saw what was coming, and would have made an attempt
to save myself had not the doors been already closed upon
me. Not a chance was left me; the dreaded surgeon came,
he examined my leg; but with all his ability and experience,
he would perhaps have been deceived had not the cruel
governor privately communicated the reasons he had to
believe me an impostor. Of course, he had little merit
after that of probing the thing to the bottom; he unbundled
it all anew, and putting on a knowing face: “I verily believe,”
he said, “the rogue has nothing amiss with his leg,
any more than I have with my eyes; I see through it; bring
me some warm water;” which being done, he proceeded
to restore it to its natural form and colour. I had not a
word to say in my defence, and held my tongue.</p>
<p>The governor then ordered me to be presented with a
shirt, as he had promised, and this was nothing but a most
severe flagellation, administered by a stout fellow, who laid
on, at the governor’s special order, with right good will on
my bare carcase. After thirty lashes he stopped; I was
dressed by the same surgeon, and told to take myself off,
spite of my smarting, at double quick time, under a more
terrible penalty were I again found in the same territories.
This advice was quite superfluous. I hastened from the
accursed spot, shrugging up my shoulders, and marched as
quickly as possible to reach the milder government of the
Pope. I uttered a thousand benedictions at the sight of
my well-loved Rome once more; I wept for joy as I entered
it, and wished that I had arms long enough to embrace it
with the devoted love of some returning prodigal son or
happy pilgrim.</p>
<p>I rejoined my comrades, and took care not to say a word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
of the new marks of honour I had brought back with me;
there would have been no end to their raillery, and I should
never have heard the last of it. I merely said I had been
making a little excursion to the adjacent villages, but, with
the exception of Rome, there was no place on which our
profession could fairly rely, either for profit or safety. I
had indeed been a great ass to leave such a city at all.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="OF_THE_WICKED_OLD_HOUSEKEEPER"> <i>OF THE WICKED OLD HOUSEKEEPER, AND
THE FIRST KNAVISH PRANKS PAUL
PLAYED AT ALCALA.</i></h3>
<p class="drop-cap">W<span class="smcap">hen</span> you are at Rome, do as they do at Rome,
says the old proverb; and it is well said. I took
it so seriously into consideration, that I fully resolved to
play the knave among knaves, and to excel them all if
possible. I know not whether I succeeded to my wish,
but I am sure I used all my endeavours. In the first place,
I made a law that it should be no less than death for any
pigs to cross the threshold of our house, or for any of the
old housekeeper’s chickens to run out of the yard into our
room. It happened that one day two of the cleverest
porkers that ever my eyes beheld slipped into our
dominions; I was then at play with the other servants, and
hearing them grunt, said to one of my companions, “Go
see who it is that grunts in our house;” he went, and
brought word they were actually two swine.</p>
<p>No sooner did I hear, then off I set in a passion,
exclaiming—“It was a great deal of impudence in them
to grunt in other people’s houses.” Then slamming to the
door, in a sudden heat of blood, I ran my sword into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
throats of them both, and we afterwards cut off their
heads. To prevent their cries for rescue, we all set up
our voices to the highest pitch during the operation, and
between us they soon gave up the ghost. We next
paunched them, saved the blood, and by the help of our
straw bed half roasted them in the yard, so that all was
over before our masters came home, except the mere
making of the black puddings. Don Diego and our
steward were informed of this exploit, and flew into such
a passion, that the other lodgers, highly amused, were fain
to take my part.</p>
<p>The don asked me what I should say for myself when
the affair should be found out. I replied that I would
plead hunger, the common sanctuary of all scholars; and
if that was not enough, I would urge that, seeing them
come into the house without knocking, just as if they had
been at home, I really thought that they were ours. They
all laughed, and Don Diego said, “By my faith, Paul, you
begin to understand the trade.” It was well worth observing
the difference between my master and me; he so sober
and religious, I so arch and roguish, so that the one was a
foil to the other, and served to set off either his virtue or
his vice. Our old housekeeper was pleased to the very
heart, for we both played our parts, and conspired against
the larder. I was caterer, and a mere Judas in my employment,
ever since retaining an inclination for cribbing and
stealing. The meat always wasted in the old woman’s
keeping, and she never dressed wedder mutton when she
could get ewe or goat. Besides, she picked the flesh off
the bones before she boiled them, so that the dishes she
served up looked as if the cattle had all died of a consumption.
The broth was so clear, that had it been as
hard as the bones, it might have passed for crystal; but
when she wanted to make it seem a little fat, she clapped
in a few candles’ ends. When I was by, she would say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
to my master, “In truth, sir, Paul is the best servant in
Spain, bating his unluckiness, but that may well enough be
borne with, because he is so honest.” I gave her the same
character, and so we put upon the whole house between
us.</p>
<p>When I bought anything at market for the real value, the
old body would pretend to fall out and quarrel; and she,
seeming to be in a passion, would say, “Do not tell me,
Paul, that this is a pennyworth of salad.” At this I
pretended to cry and make a great noise, beseeching my
master that he would please to send the steward, that he
might prove the base calumny of the scolding old woman.
By such simple means did we both retain our character for
honesty; she appearing to look sharp after me, and I
always being found out to be trustworthy. Don Diego,
highly pleased, would often say, “Would to God, Paul
were as virtuous in other ways as he is honest; I see, my
good woman, he is even better than you represent him.”
It was thus we had leisure and opportunity to feast on
them like horse-leeches.</p>
<p>If you ask how much we might cheat them of in the
year’s round, I can only say it amounted to a considerable
sum; yet the old woman never missed going to church
daily, nor did I perceive any scruple of conscience she
made of it, though she was so great a saint. She always
wore a pair of beads about her neck, so big, that the wood
of them might have served to roast a sirloin of beef. It
was all hung with medals, crosses, pictures, and other
trinkets, on all which, she said, she prayed every night for
her benefactors. She would pray longer than any fanatical
preacher, always in dog Latin, the sound of which almost
made us split our sides with laughter.</p>
<p>The old woman kept fowls, and had about a dozen fine
grown chickens, which made my mouth water, for they
were fit for any gentleman’s table. It happened one day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
going to feed them, she called, as is the custom in Spain,
very loud: “Pio, Pio, Pio.” She repeated it so often, that
I cried out in a pretended rage—</p>
<p>“’Fore God! nurse, I wish I had seen you kill a man, or
clip and coin, for then I might have kept your counsel; but
now I must be forced to discover you. The Lord have
mercy upon us both, I say.”</p>
<p>She, seeing me in such disorder, was somewhat alarmed:
“Why, Paul,” she said, “what have I done? pray do not
jest with me.”</p>
<p>“Jest with you, forsooth, a curse on your iniquity! I
cannot avoid giving information to the Inquisition, or I
shall be excommunicated.”</p>
<p>“Oh Lord! the Inquisition; have I committed any
crime, then?”</p>
<p>“Have you <i>not</i>?” I answered; “ don’t think to trifle with
the Inquisitors; own you are in the wrong; eat your own
words as fast as you can, and deny not the blasphemy and
irreverence.”</p>
<p>She replied in great consternation: “But, Paul, will they
punish me if I recant?”</p>
<p>“No,” I replied, “they will then only absolve you.”</p>
<p>“Then I recant,” said she; “only tell me what it is I
have to recant; for I know nothing of it, as I hope for
mercy.”</p>
<p>“Bless me,” replied I; “is it possible you should be so
dull? the irreverence was so great I hardly know how to
express it. Wretch as you are, did you not call the
chickens, Pio, Pio; and Pius is the name of several Popes,
who are Christ’s vicars upon earth, and heads of the
church. Now do you consider whether that be any trifling
sin?”</p>
<p>She stood as if she had been thunderstruck, and after
a while cried: “’Tis true, I said so, Paul; but may I
be burnt if I did it with any ill design. I recant—I do,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
indeed; and try to find some way not to inform of me;
for I shall die if they get me into the Inquisition.”</p>
<p>“Provided you take your oath on the holy altar that you
meant it not for blasphemy; but then you must give me
the two chickens you called in that unsanctified way, by
the names of the Popes, that they may be burnt by the
officers of the Inquisition. This you must do now, or
I shall otherwise be compelled to lay an information against
you as quick as possible.”</p>
<p>She was glad to escape so easily, and instantly consented,
giving me three instead of two, which I took to a neighbouring
cook, had them dressed, and ate with my companions.
Don Diego came to hear of the trick, and made
excellent sport of it in the family. The old woman had
nearly fretted herself to death for mere vexation, and was
a thousand times in the mind of taking revenge, and
discovering all my schemes. She was, however, too deeply
implicated; and having once quarrelled with me, there
was no end to the tricks I played her. In short, I
became a great authority in all that the scholars called
snatching and shop-lifting, at which I had many pleasant
adventures.</p>
<p>One evening, about nine o’clock, as I was passing
through the great street, I spied a confectioner’s shop open,
and in it a frail of raisins upon the counter. I whipped
in, took hold of it, and set a-running; the confectioner
scoured after me, and so did several neighbours and
servants. Being loaded, I perceived that, though I had
the start, they would overtake me, and so, turning the
corner of a street, I clapped the frail upon the ground and
sat down upon it, and wrapping my cloak about my leg,
began to cry out, “God forgive him, he has trod upon me
and crippled me.” When they came up I began to cry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
“For God’s sake, pity the lame; I pray God you may
never be lame!”</p>

<div class="caption"> “‘FRIEND,’ THEY EXCLAIMED, ‘DID YOU SEE A MAN RUN THIS WAY?’”</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>
<p>“Friend!” they exclaimed, “did you see a man run this
way?”</p>
<p>“He is before you,” was my answer, “for he trod upon
me.”</p>
<p>I boasted of this exploit, and with some reason: I even
invited them to come and see me steal a box of sweetmeats
another night. They came, and observing that all
the boxes were so far within the shop, that there was no
reaching them, they concluded the thing was impracticable.
Drawing my sword, however, about a dozen paces from
the shop, I ran on, and crying out at the door, “You are
a dead man!” I made a strong pass just before the confectioner’s
breast, who dropped down calling for help; and
my sword running clean through a box of sweetmeats, I
drew it, box and all, and took to my heels. They were all
amazed at the contrivance, and ready to burst with laughing
on hearing him bid the people search him, for that he was
badly wounded; even when he found out the cheat he
continued to bless himself, while I was employed in eating
the fruits of my exploit. My comrades used to say that I
could easily maintain my family upon nothing; as much as
to say, by my wits and sleight-of-hand. This had the effect
of encouraging me to commit more. I used to bring home
my girdle, hung all round with little pitchers, which I stole
from nuns, begging some water to drink of them; and
when they turned it out in their wheel, I went off with the
mugs, they being shut up and not able to help themselves.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">W<span class="smcap">hen</span> I had been there five weeks, to reward my
good service, I was prefe to be under-sweeper
below stairs. Thus men rise who behave themselves well in
their employment, and are careful to please their superiors.
I was barefoot, half-naked, and as black as a collier, when I
entered upon my new charge, where I fared not so well as
in the kitchen; for places of honour are not often so profitable
as those of less reputation, and nothing could stick to
me but the dust of the house, whereas before I never
wanted a sop in the pan, or other perquisites.</p>

<div class="caption">“I CAME TO THE SEASHORE.”</div>
</div>
<p>But Fortune so ordered it that the Cardinal’s servants
undertook to act a play on his Eminency’s birthday; and in
distributing the parts, they pitched upon me to represent a
young King of Leon, either because I was young, or for being
descended from the renowned Fernan Gonzales, who, as I
said before, was my progenitor, and Earl of Castile, before
there were kings of that country. I took care to learn my
part, and persuaded him that took the management of it to
give me half a pound of raisins and a couple of oranges
every day, that I might eat a little collation at night, and
rub my temples with the orange-peels in the morning
fasting, telling him that would help my memory, which was
very weak, else I should never get it by heart, tho’ the
whole was not above twenty lines; and assuring him I had
seen this done by the most celebrated comedians in Spain,
when they acted the greatest parts. When the day of
the solemnity came, a stately theatre was erected in the
largest room in the palace, making a wood of green boughs
at the end next the attiring room, where I was to lye asleep,
and Moors to come and carry me away captive. My lord,
the Cardinal, invited all the men of quality and ladies of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
the court to this diversion. Our Merry-Andrew actors
dressed themselves like so many Jack-Puddings, and all the
palace was richly hung and adorned. They put me on a
very fine cloth suit, half cover’d with rich silver loops, and
laced down the seams, which was as good as giving me
wings to take my flight and be gone. Seeing myself in such
equipage as I had never known before, I thought not fit to
return to my rags again, but resolv’d to shift for myself.
The play began at three in the afternoon, the audience
consisting of all the flower of the city. The manager of
the representation was so active and watchful, because he
had hir’d my clothes, and was bound to see them forthcoming,
that he never suffered me to go out of his sight.
But when they came to that part where I was to appear as
if I had been hunting, and then to lye down in the wood,
pretending weariness and sleep; I repeated a few verses,
and those who came out with me upon the stage having
left me, I turn’d into that green copse, where it cannot be
said I was taken napping, for going in at one end I follow’d
a narrow path that was left among the boughs, to the other
end of the theatre, whence I slipped down, and going along
under it to the door of that great hall, bid those who stood
about it, make way, for I was going to shift my clothes.
Upon this they all let me pass, I made but two steps down
the stairs, and flew along the streets like an arrow out of a
bow, till I came to the sea-shore, whither I had steer’d my
course, in hopes of some conveniency to carry me off. I
was told afterwards when I returned to Palermo, that at the
time when I quitted the stage, there came out half-a-dozen
Christian Moors, well stuff’d with gammon of bacon, and encouraged
with rich wine; who coming to the wood to seize
their prize, thinking I had been there,  cry’d out with loud
voice: “Young Christian King, appear!” To which I
supposing them to be my servants, was to answer, “Is it
time to move?” I being then too far on my way, not for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
fear of being made a slave among infidels, but rather of
being stripped of my fine clothes, could not play my part,
or answer to the Moors, because I was a mile off, driving a
bargain with Christians. The prompter perceiving I did
not answer, was very diligent, repeating what I was to say,
as believing I had forgot myself, tho’ he was much mistaken,
for I had all my business fresh in my head. The
Moors being tired with expectation, and concluding I had
really fallen asleep, when I ought only to counterfeit, went
into the imaginary wood, and found no footsteps of a King.
They were all amazed, there was no proceeding on the play;
some ran about calling upon me, and others went to enquire
after my Majesty, whilst he, who had engag’d for my
clothes, tore his hair for vexation, and offer’d  vows to
Heaven in case I were found, and he escaped that shipwreck.
They told the Cardinal I was fled, who answered, I
was much in the right to make my escape from the enemies
of the Christian religion, and not suffer myself to be made
prisoner by them. That, without doubt, I was gone back
to the city of Leon, where I kept my court, whence it was
likely I would take care to return the clothes; but in the
meanwhile, he would pay the value, so that they need not
take the trouble of sending after me, for he would not disoblige
so great a prince, especially on his birthday. He
ordered my part should be read, and the rest of the play
acted; which was done accordingly, to the great satisfaction
of the audience, and no less of the manager, having such
good security for his clothes.</p>

QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class="center small"><i>Which treats of the condition and way of life of the famous gentleman,
Don Quixote of La Mancha.</i></p>
<p class="drop-cap">I<span class="smcap">n</span> a certain village of La Mancha, whose name I will
not recall, there lived not long ago a gentleman—one
of those who keep a lance in the rack, an ancient target, a
lean hackney, and a greyhound for coursing. A mess of
somewhat more beef than mutton, a salad on most nights,
a hotch-potch on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, with the
addition of a pigeon on Sundays, consumed three parts of
his substance. The rest of it was spent in a doublet of fine
broadcloth, a pair of velvet breeches for holidays, with
slippers of the same, and his home-spun of the finest, with
which he decked himself on week-days. He kept at home
a housekeeper, who was past forty, and a niece who had
not yet reached twenty, besides a lad for the field and
market, who saddled the nag and handled the pruning-hook.</p>
<p>The age of our gentleman bordered upon fifty years.
He was of a vigorous constitution, spare of flesh, dry of
visage, a great early riser, and a lover of the chase. They
affirm that his surname was Quejada, or Quesada (and in
this there is some variance among the authors who treat of
the matter), although by very probable conjectures we are
led to conclude that he was called Quijana. But this is of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
small import to our story; enough that in the telling of it
we swerve not a jot from the truth.</p>
<p>Be it known, then, that this gentleman above mentioned,
during the interval that he was idle, which was the greater
part of the year, gave himself up to the reading of books of
chivalries, with so much fervour and relish, that he almost
entirely neglected the exercise of the chase and even the
management of his estate. And to such a pitch did his
curiosity and infatuation reach, that he sold many acres of
arable land in order to buy romances of chivalry to read;
and so he brought home as many of them as he could
procure. And of all none seemed to him so good as those
composed by the famous Feliciano de Silva, for their
brilliancy of style and those entangled sentences seemed
to him to be very pearls; and especially when he came to
read of the passages of love, and cartels of defiance, wherein
he often found written things like these: “<i>The reason of
the unreason which is done to my reason in such wise my
reason debilitates, that with reason I complain of your
beauteousness</i>.” And also when he read: “<i>The lofty
heavens which of your divinity do divinely fortify you with
the constellations, and make you deserver of the deserts which
your mightiness deserves</i>.”</p>
<p>Over these reasons our poor gentleman lost his senses,
and he used to keep awake at night in trying to comprehend
them, and in plucking out their meaning, which not
Aristotle himself could extract or understand, were he to
come to life for that special purpose. He did not much
fancy the wounds which Don Belianis gave and received;
for he thought that, however potent were the masters who
had healed him, the Knight could not but have his face and
all his body full of scars and marks. Nevertheless, he
praised in the author the ending of his book with the
promise of that interminable adventure, and ofttimes he
was seized with a desire to take up the pen, and put a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
finish to it in good earnest, as is there purposed. And
doubtless he would have done so—aye, and gone through
with it—had not other greater and more lasting thoughts
diverted his mind.</p>
<p>Many times he held dispute with the Priest of his village
(who was a learned man, a graduate of Siguenza) as to who
should have been the better knight, Palmerin of England,
or Amadis of Gaul; though Master Nicholas, the Barber of
the same village, was used to say that none came up to the
Knight of the Sun, and that if any one could compare with
him it was Don Galaor, brother of Amadis of Gaul, for he
had a very accommodating temper for everything; he was
no prudish cavalier, nor such a sniveller as his brother, nor
in the article of valour any behind him.</p>
<p>In fine, our gentleman was so absorbed in these studies,
that he passed his nights reading from eve to dawn, and his
days from dark to dusk; and so with little sleep and much
study his brain dried up, to the end that he lost his wits.
He filled himself with the imagination of all that he read in
the books: with enchantments, with quarrels, battles,
challenges, wounds, amorous plaints, loves, torments, and
follies impossible. And so assured was he of the truth of
all that mass of fantastic inventions of which he read, that
for him there was no other history in the world so certain.
He would say that the Cid Ruy Diaz must have been a
good knight, but not to be named with the Knight of the
Flaming Sword, who only with one back-stroke had severed
two fierce and monstrous giants through the middle. He
better liked Bernardo del Carpio, because at Roncesvalles
he had slain Orlando the Enchanted, availing himself of
Hercules’ trick when he throttled Anteus, son of Terra, in
his arms. He spoke very well of the giant Morgante; for,
though of that gigantesque brood who are all arrogant
and uncivil, he alone was affable and well-mannered. But,
above all, he esteemed Rinaldo of Montalvan, especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
when he saw him sally from his castle and rob all he met,
and when in Heathenrie he stole that idol of Mahound,
which was all of gold, as his history tells. As for the traitor
Galalon, for a volley of kicks at him he would have given
his housekeeper—aye, and his niece to boot. In short, his
wits utterly wrecked, he fell into the strangest delusion ever
madman conceived in the world, and this was, that it was
fitting and necessary for him, as he thought, both for the
augmenting of his honour and the service of the State, to
make himself a Knight Errant, and travel through the
world with his armour and his horse seeking for adventures,
and to exercise himself in all that he had read that the
Knight Errant practised, redressing all kinds of wrong, and
placing himself in perils and passes by the surmounting of
which he might achieve an everlasting name and fame.
Already the poor man imagined himself, by the valour of
his arm, crowned with, at the least, the Empire of Trebizond.
And so, with these imaginations so delightful, rapt
in the strange zest with which they inspired him, he made
haste to give effect to what he desired. The first thing he
did was to furbish up some armour which had belonged to
his great-grandfathers, which, eaten with rust and covered
with mould, had lain for ages, where it had been put away
and forgotten, in a corner. He scoured and dressed it as
well as he was able, but he saw that it had one great defect,
which was that there was no covered helmet, but only a
simple morion or, headpiece. This his ingenuity supplied,
for, with pieces of pasteboard, he fashioned a sort of half-beaver,
which, fitted to the morion, gave it the appearance
of a complete helmet. The fact is that, to prove it to be
strong and able to stand the chance of a sword-cut, he
drew his sword and gave it a couple of strokes, demolishing
with the very first in a moment what had cost him a week
to make. The ease with which he had knocked it to pieces
not seeming to him good, in order to secure himself against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
this danger he set to making it anew, fitting some bars of
iron within in such a manner as to leave him satisfied with
his defence; and without caring to make a fresh trial of it,
he constituted and accepted it for a very perfect good
helmet. He went then to inspect his nag, a beast which,
though it had more quarters than there are in a real, and
more blemishes than the horse of Gonela, who, <i>tantum pellis
et ossa fuit</i>, appeared to him to surpass Alexander’s Bucephalus
and the Ci Bavieca. Four days were spent by
our gentlemen in meditating on what name to give him;
for, as he said to himself, it was not right that the steed of
Knight so famous, and in himself so good, should be
without a recognised appellation; and therefore he endeavoured
to fit him with one which should signify what
he had been prior to his belonging to a Knight Errant, and
what he was then; since he thought it but right that, the
master having changed his condition, the horse should also
change his name, and get him one sublime and high-sounding,
as befitted the new order and the new office
which he professed. And so, after many names which he
devised, effaced, and rejected, amended, re-made and un-made
in his mind and fancy, finally he decided to call him
<span class="smcap">Rozinante</span>—a name, in his opinion, lofty, sonorous, and
significative of what his animal had been when he was a
common hackney, before he became what he now was,
before, and in front of, all the hackneys in the world.</p>
<p>Having given to his horse a name so much to his liking, he
then desired to give one to himself, and the thinking of this
cost him eight other days. At last he decided to call himself
<span class="smcap">Don Quixote</span>; whereupon the authors of this truthful
history, as has been said, have found occasion to affirm that
his name was Quijada, and not Quesada, as others would
have it. Then recollecting that the valorous Amadis was
not contented with calling himself simply Amadis, but added
the name of his kingdom and native country, to make it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
famous, taking the name of Amadis of Gaul, so he desired,
like a good knight, to add to his own the name of his native
land, and call himself <span class="smcap">Don Quixote of La Mancha</span>,
whereby, to his seeming, he made lively proclamation of
his lineage and his country, and honoured it by taking his
surname therefrom.</p>
<p>His armour then being cleaned, his morion manufactured
into a helmet, a name given to his horse, and himself confirmed
with a new one, it struck him that he lacked nothing
else than to look for a lady of whom to be enamoured; for
the Knight Errant without amours was a tree without
leaves and without fruit, and a body without soul. He
would say to himself: “Were I, for my sins, or through good
luck, to encounter hereabouts some giant, as usually
happens to Knights Errant, and to overthrow him at the
onset, or cleave him through the middle of his body,
or, in fine, vanquish him and make him surrender, would
it not be well to have some one to whom to send him
as a present, that he might enter and bend the knee
before my sweet mistress, and say with humble and subdued
voice: ‘I, lady, am the giant Caraculiambro, lord of
the island of Malindramia, whom the never-to-be-praised-as-he-deserves
Knight, Don Quixote of La Mancha, vanquished
in single combat—he who hath commanded me to
present myself before your grace that your highness may
dispose of me at your pleasure.’”</p>
<p>Oh, how our good knight was pleased with himself when
he had delivered this speech!—and the more when he found
one to whom to give the name of his lady. It happened,
as the belief is, that in a village near his own there was a
well-looking peasant girl, with whom he had once fallen in
love, though it is understood that she never knew it or had
proof thereof. Her name was Aldonza Lorenzo, and upon
her he judged it fit to bestow the title of mistress of his
fancy; and, seeking for her a name which should not much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
belie her own, and yet incline and approach to that of a
princess or great lady, he decided to call her <span class="smcap">Dulcinea del
Toboso</span>, for she was a native of El Toboso—a name, in his
opinion, musical, romantic, and significant, as were all
which he had given to himself and his belongings.</p>
<p class="center small"><i>Wherein is related the pleasant method by which Don Quixote got himself
dubbed Knight.</i></p>
<p>... Don Quixote promised to perform all that was recommended
to him with all exactness; whereupon he was
enjoined forthwith to keep watch over his armour in a large
yard by the inn-side. Collecting the pieces all together, he
placed them on top of a stone trough which stood near a
well, and, buckling on his shield, he grasped his lance, and
began with a jaunty air to pace in front of the trough, it
being now dark when he commenced his exercise.</p>
<p>The landlord told all who were staying in the inn of his
guest’s craze, the watching of the armour, and the dubbing
of Knighthood which he awaited. Wondering at this
strange kind of madness, they went to look at him from
afar, and saw him sometimes pacing with a tranquil mien,
sometimes resting on his lance, with his eyes fixed on his
armour, from which he would not take them off for some
time. The night had now closed in, with a moon of such
brightness that she might have vied with him who lent it to
her,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_6" id="FNanchor_6">[6]</a> so that whatever our novice did could be plainly seen
by all. Just then one of the muleteers who were staying in
the inn, wanting to give water to his team, found it necessary
to remove Don Quixote’s armour from where it lay on
the trough. The Knight, seeing the man approach, exclaimed
with a loud voice:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span> “O thou, whosoever thou art,
rash cavalier! who comest to touch the armour of the most
valiant Errant that ever girt sword on himself, take heed
what thou doest, and touch it not, if thou wouldst not lose
thy life in forfeit of thy temerity.”</p>
<p>The muleteer paid no regard to these words (and better
for him it had been had he regarded them, for he would
have re-guarded his safety), but, taking hold of the armour
by the straps, flung it some way from him. When Don
Quixote saw this, he lifted his eyes to heaven, and addressing
himself, as it seemed, to his Lady Dulcinea,
cried, “Succour me, mistress mine, in this the first affront
which is offered to this enthralled bosom: let not your
favour and help fail me in this first trial!”</p>
<p>And uttering these and other such words, and loosing his
shield, he raised his lance in both hands, and with it dealt
such a mighty blow on the muleteer’s head that it felled
him to the earth in such ill plight that, if it had been
followed up with a second, there would have been no need
of a leech to cure him. Soon after, another muleteer, without
knowing what had passed (for the first still lay stunned),
came up with the same purpose of giving water to his
mules, and was going to remove the armour so as to clear
the trough, when Don Quixote, without speaking a word or
asking any one’s favour, again loosed his shield and again
raised his lance, and without breaking it made more than
three of the second muleteer’s head, for he broke it into
four pieces. At the noise all the people of the inn ran out,
and the landlord among them. Seeing this, Don Quixote
buckled on his shield, and, setting his hand to his sword,
cried, “O lady of beauty! strength and vigour of this debile
heart! now is the hour when you should turn the eyes of
your grandeur on this your captive Knight, who is awaiting
this mighty adventure!”</p>
<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="illus-b098">
<img alt="" src="images/illus-b098.jpg" id="id-6700447562590779584">
<div class="caption"> “DEALT SUCH A MIGHTY BLOW ON THE MULETEER’S HEAD, THAT IT
FELLED HIM TO THE EARTH.”</div>
</div>
<p>Thereupon he seemed to himself to acquire so much
courage, that if all the muleteers in the world had assailed
him he would not have budged a foot backwards. The
companions of the wounded, seeing them in that plight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
began to shower stones upon Don Quixote from a distance,
who sheltered himself as well as he could with his
shield, not venturing to leave the horse-trough lest he
should seem to abandon his armour. The innkeeper called
out to them to leave him alone, for he had told them already
that it was a madman, and being mad he would be scot-free
even if he killed them all. Don Quixote also cried out
yet louder, calling them cowards and traitors, and declaring
the Lord of the castle to be a craven and a base-born Knight
for consenting to Knights Errant being so treated, and that
if he himself had received the order of Knighthood he
would have made him sensible of his perfidy: “But of you,
base and wild rabble, I make no account. Shoot! come
on! advance! assail me as much as ye are able; you shall
see the penalty you have to pay for your folly and insolence!”</p>
<p>This he said with so much spirit and intrepidity that he
struck all who heard him with a terrible fear; and therefore,
and partly by the host’s persuasions, they left off
pelting him, and he on his part permitted them to carry off
their wounded, returning to the vigil of his arms with the
same calmness and composure as before.</p>
<p>These pranks of his guest were not to the innkeeper’s
liking, so he determined to despatch and give him that
plaguy order of Knighthood forthwith, before other mischief
should happen. Going up to him, therefore, he apologised
for the insolence with which those base fellows had behaved
without his knowledge, but, he added, they had been well
chastised for their hardihood. And seeing there was no
chapel in that castle, as he had said before, there was no
need, he declared, for the rest of the performance—that
the whole point of Knight-making consisted in the slap of
the hand and the stroke on the shoulder, according to his
knowledge of the ceremonial of the order, and this could
be done in the middle of a field; and that Don Quixote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
had already accomplished all that pertained to the watching
of arms, more by token that he had been more than four
hours at what might have been finished off with a two hours’
watch.</p>
<p>To all this Don Quixote gave credence, and he said to
the host that he was there ready to obey him, praying him
to conclude the business as soon as possible, for, were he
assaulted again when full Knight, he purposed not to leave
any one alive in the castle, except those he might spare at
the Castellan’s bidding, and out of regard for him.</p>
<p>The Castellan, thus forewarned, and apprehensive of
what might happen, brought out a book in which he used to
enter the straw and barley which he supplied to the muleteers,
and, with a candle-end borne by a lad, the two damsels
aforesaid with him, went up to where Don Quixote was
standing, whom he ordered to go down on his knees.
Reading in his manual as though he were reciting some
devout prayer, he broke off in the middle, and, lifting up
his hand, dealt Don Quixote a sound blow on the head, and
after this a brisk thwack on the shoulder with his own sword,
still muttering between his teeth as though he were praying.
This done, he commanded one of those ladies to gird on
Don Quixote’s sword, which she did with much sprightliness
and discretion, and it needed no little of that last article to
avoid bursting with laughter at each point of the ceremonies,
though the prowesses they had witnessed of the
new Knight kept their mirth within bounds. At the girding
on of the sword the good lady said, “God make your
worship a fortunate Knight, and give you good luck in
battles!” Don Quixote besought her to tell him her name,
that thenceforward he might know to whom he was indebted
for the favour received, for he designed to bestow on her
some portion of the honour which he was to reap by the
valour of his arm. She replied, with much humility, that
her name was <i>La Tolosa</i>, and that she was the daughter of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
a cobbler, native of Toledo, who lived among the stalls of
Sancho Bienaya, and that wheresoever she might be, she
was at his service and took him for her master. Don
Quixote begged her in reply, for love of him, henceforth
to assume the <i>Don</i>, and call herself Donna Tolosa, which
she promised to do. The other damsel buckled on him his
spurs, with whom there passed almost the same colloquy as
with her of the sword. He asked her her name, and she
answered that she was called <i>La Molinera</i>, and was the
daughter of a miller of Antequera. Her also Don Quixote
besought to take upon her the <i>Don</i>, and call herself Donna
Molinera, renewing his offers of service and favour.</p>
<p>These never-before-seen ceremonies having been despatched
at a gallop and post-haste, Don Quixote could not
rest till he saw himself on horseback, sallying forth in quest
of adventures. So saddling Rozinante at once he mounted,
and embracing the innkeeper, thanked him for the favour
done in the knighting in terms so extravagant that it is
impossible to give an exact relation of them. The innkeeper,
seeing him well outside his inn, responded to his
speeches with others no less flowery although more brief,
and, without asking him for the cost of his lodging, let him
go with a hearty good will.</p>
<p class="hang small"><i>Of the good success which Don Quixote had in the terrible and never-before
imagined adventure of the windmills, with other events worthy of
happy remembrance.</i></p>
<p>While thus conversing, they caught sight of some thirty
or forty windmills which are in that plain, and as soon as
Don Quixote perceived them, he exclaimed—</p>
<p>“Fortune is guiding our affairs better than we could have
desired, for look yonder, friend Sancho, where thirty or more
huge giants are revealed, with whom I intend to do battle,
and take all their lives. With their spoils we will begin to
enrich ourselves, for this is fair war, and it is doing God<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
great service to clear this evil spawn from off the face of
the earth.</p>
<p>“What giants?” asked Sancho Panza.</p>
<p>“Those thou seest there,” replied his master, “with the
long arms, which some of them are wont to have of two
leagues’ length.”</p>
<p>“Take care, sir,” cried Sancho, “for those we see yonder
are not giants, but windmills, and what in them look like
arms are the sails which, being whirled about by the wind,
make the mill-stone to go.”</p>
<p>“It is manifest,” answered Don Quixote, “that thou art
not experienced in this matter of adventures. They are
giants, and if thou art afraid get thee away home and
dispose thyself to prayer, while I go to engage with them in
fierce and unequal combat.”</p>
<p>So saying, he clapped spurs to Rozinante, his steed,
without heeding the cries which Sancho Panza, his squire,
uttered, warning him that those he was going to encounter
were beyond all doubt windmills and not giants. But he
went on so fully persuaded that they were giants, that he
neither listened to the cries of his squire Sancho, nor
stopped to mark what they were, but shouted to them in
a loud voice—</p>
<p>“Fly not, cowards, vile creatures, for it is a single
cavalier who assails you!”</p>
<p>A slight breeze having sprung up at this moment, the
great sail-arms began to move, on perceiving which Don
Quixote cried—</p>
<p>“Although ye should wield more arms than had the giant
Briareus, ye shall pay for it!”</p>
<p>Saying this, and commending himself with his whole soul
to his lady Dulcinea, beseeching her to succour him in this
peril, well covered with his buckler, with his lance in rest,
he charged at Rozinante’s best gallop, and attacked the first
mill before him and thrusting his lance into the sail the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
wind turned it with so much violence that the lance was
shivered to pieces, carrying with it the horse and his rider,
who was sent rolling over the plain sorely damaged.</p>
<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="illus-b103">

<div class="caption"> “THE HORSE AND HIS RIDER SENT ROLLING OVER THE PLAIN
SORELY DAMAGED.”</div>
</div>
<p>Sancho Panza hastened to his master’s help as fast as his
ass could go, and when he came up he found the Knight
unable to stir, such a shock had Rozinante given him in
the fall.</p>
<p>“God bless me,” cried Sancho, “did I not tell your
worship to look to what you were doing, for they were
nought but windmills? And nobody could mistake them
but one who had other such in his head.”</p>
<p>“Peace, friend Sancho,” said Don Quixote; “for the
things of war are more than other subject to continual
mutation. And, moreover, I believe, and that is the truth,
that the same sage Friston, who robbed me of my room
and my books, hath turned these giants into windmills, in
order to deprive me of the glory of their overthrow, so
great is the enmity he bears to me; but in the upshot his
evil arts shall little avail against the goodness of my
sword.”</p>
<p>“God send it as He will,” answered Sancho; and helping
him to rise, the Knight remounted Rozinante, whose
shoulders were half dislocated.</p>
<p class="center small"><i>Which treats of the lofty adventure and the rich winning of
Mambrino’s helmet.</i></p>
<p>... Now, the truth of the matter as to the helmet, the
horse, and the Knight that Don Quixote saw was this.
There were in that neighbourhood two villages, one so small
that it possessed neither apothecary’s shop nor barber, which
the other, close to it, had; and so the barber of the larger
village did duty for the smaller, in which was a sick man
who required to be blooded, and another who wanted
shaving; on which account the barber was coming, bringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
with him a brass basin; and it chanced that, at the
time he was travelling, it commenced to rain, and, not to
spoil his hat, which was a new one, he clapt upon his head
the basin, which, being a clean one, shone half a league
off. He rode upon a grey ass, as Sancho said, and this was
how to Don Quixote there appeared the dapple-grey steed
and the Knight and the helmet of gold, for all things that he
saw he made to fall in very easily with his wild chivalries
and his vagabond fancies. And, when he perceived that
luckless horseman draw near, without stopping to parley
with him, he ran at him with his lance couched at
Rozinante’s full gallop, with intent to pierce him through
and through; and as he came up to him, without abating
the fury of his career, he cried out—</p>
<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="illus-b105">
<img alt="" src="images/illus-b105.jpg" id="id-7404253795917633585">
<div class="caption">“BEGAN TO RACE ACROSS THE PLAIN FASTER THAN THE WIND.”</div>
</div>
<p>“Defend thyself, vile caitiff creature, or render me up of
thine own will that which by all right is my due.”</p>
<p>The barber, who saw that apparition bearing down upon
him, without thought or apprehension of any such thing,
had no other way to save himself from the thrust of the
lance than to let himself fall off his ass, and no sooner had
he touched the ground when he rose more nimbly than a
deer, and began to race across the plain faster than the
wind. The basin he left upon the ground, with which
Don Quixote was well content, remarking that the Paynim
had done wisely, and that he had imitated the beaver, who,
when he finds himself hard pressed by the hunters, tears
and cuts off with his teeth that for which he knows by
natural instinct he is chased. He bade Sancho pick up the
helmet, who, taking it in his hands, said—</p>
<p>“In sooth the basin is a good one, and worth a real of
eight, if it is worth a maravedi.”</p>
<p>He gave it to his master, who placed it upon his head,
turning it about from side to side in search of the vizor,
and, not finding it, he said—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>
<p>“Doubtless the Paynim to whose measure this famous
headpiece was first forged, must have had a very large
head, and the worst of it is that half of it is wanting.”</p>
<p>When Sancho heard him call the basin a headpiece, he
could not contain his laughter, but bethinking him of his
master’s wrath, he checked himself in the midst of it.</p>
<p>“What dost thou laugh at?” asked Don Quixote.</p>
<p>“I am laughing,” replied he, “for thinking of the big
head the Paynim owner of this helmet must have had, for it
looks for all the world like nothing but a perfect barber’s
basin.”</p>
<p>“Knowest thou what I suspect, Sancho? That this
famous piece of the enchanted helmet must by some strange
accident have come into the hands of one who did not
know or esteem its worth, and who, ignorant of what he
did, seeing it to be of pure gold, must have melted down
the other half of it to profit by its worth, and of this half
he has made what looks to thee like a barber’s basin, as
thou sayest. But, be that as it may, to me who recognise
it, its transmutation makes no matter, for I will have it
rectified in the first village where there is a smith, and in
such wise that it shall not be surpassed or even approached
by that which was made and forged by the god of smithies
for the god of battles. And, in the meantime, I will wear it
as I can, for something is better than nothing; all the
more as it will well suffice to protect me against any blow
from a stone.”</p>
<p class="hang small"><i>Wherein is set forth the highest point and extreme to which the never-before-heard-of
courage of Don Quixote reached or could reach; with
the happily achieved Adventure of the Lions.</i></p>
<p>The history tells that Sancho, when Don Quixote called
for his helmet, was buying some curds of the shepherds,
and in his perturbation at his master’s hurried call, knew
not what to do with them or how to carry them; so in
order not to lose what he had now paid for, he bethought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
him of clapping them into his master’s helmet, and having
thus made shift, he turned back to see what Don Quixote
wanted, who, on his coming up, cried, “Give me that
helmet, friend, for I know little of adventure or that which
I descry yonder is one which should require, and does
require, me to take to arms.”</p>
<p>He of the Green Coat, hearing this, turned his eyes
every way, but saw nothing but a cart which came towards
them with two or three little flags, which made him think
that it must be carrying the King’s treasure, and so he told
Don Quixote. But the Knight would not credit it, always
supposing and imagining that all which happened was
adventures, and still adventures; and so he replied—</p>
<p>“Forewarned is forearmed; nothing is lost by taking
precaution, for I know by experience that I have enemies
visible and invisible, nor know I when, nor where, nor in
what moment, nor in what shape I have to encounter
them.”</p>
<p>And turning to Sancho he asked for his helmet, which
the squire, not having an opportunity of relieving it of the
curds, was compelled to hand to him as it was. Don
Quixote took it, and without giving a look to what it contained,
clapped it on his head in all haste; and as the curds
were squeezed and pressed, the whey began to pour over all
Don Quixote’s face and beard, from which he got such a
fright that he said to Sancho—</p>
<p>“What is this, Sancho? For methinks my skull is softening,
or my brains are melting, or I sweat from feet to head.
And if it is that I am sweating, truly it is not from fear.
Without doubt I believe this is terrible, the adventure that
now means to befall me. Give me something, if you can,
with which to wipe myself, for this copious sweat doth blind
my eyes.”</p>
<p>Sancho held his tongue and gave him a cloth, and with
it thanks to God that his master had not found out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
truth. Don Quixote wiped himself, and took off the helmet
to see what it was which seemed to chill his head, and finding
the white clots within his headpiece, held them to his
nose, and smelling them, cried—</p>
<p>“By the life of my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, but these
are curds thou hast put here, thou traitor! villain, brazen-faced
squire!”</p>
<p>To which, with much deliberation and command of
countenance, Sancho replied, “If they are curds give them
to me, your worship, and I will eat them; but let the devil
eat them, for it must be he who put them there. I to dare
soil your worship’s helmet! You must know who it is
that’s so bold. In faith, sir, as God reads my mind, I, too,
must have enchanters who persecute me as a creature and
limb of your worship; and they will have put that nastiness
there to move your patience to anger, and make you baste
my ribs as you are wont to do; but, in truth, this time they
have jumped wide of the mark, for I rely on my master’s
good judgment, who will consider that I have neither curds
nor milk about me, nor anything like; and if I had I would
rather put it into my stomach than in the helmet.”</p>
<p>“It may be all so,” quoth Don Quixote. And the
gentleman in the Green Coat, who noted all, was utterly
amazed, especially when, after Don Quixote had wiped dry
his head, face, beard, and helmet, he put it on again, and
settling himself firmly in his stirrups, reaching for his sword
and grasping his lance, exclaimed—</p>
<p>“Now come what may, for here I stand to do battle with
Satan himself in person.”</p>
<p>The cart with the flags now approached, in which was
nobody but the carter upon one of the mules and a man
seated in front. Planting himself before it, Don Quixote
exclaimed—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>
<p>“Whither go ye, my brethren; what cart is this? What
do you carry therein? And what flags are these?”</p>
<p>To which the carter replied, “The cart is mine; what go
in it are two bold lions in a cage, which the General is
sending from Oran to the capital as a present to his
Majesty; the flags are the King‘s, our master, in token that
something of his goes here.”</p>
<p>“And are they large, the lions?” asked Don Quixote.</p>
<p>“So large,” answered the man at the door of the van,
“that none larger or so large have ever passed from Africa
to Spain; and I am the lion-keeper, and have carried many,
but none like these. They are male and female; the male
goes in the first cage, and the female in the one behind,
and they are now very hungry, for they have not eaten
to-day; and so let your worship stand aside, for we must
needs reach quickly the place where we are to give them
their dinner.”</p>
<p>On which said Don Quixote, with a little smile, “Lion-whelps
to me? To me, lion-whelps? And at this time of
day? Then by Heaven, those gentleman who send them
here shall see whether I am a man who is frightened of
lions. Alight, good fellow, and since you are the lion-keeper,
open these cages, and turn me out these beasts, for
in the middle of this open field I will teach them to know
who Don Quixote of La Mancha is, in defiance and despite
of the enchanters who send them to me.”</p>
<p>“So, so,” said he of the Green Coat to himself at this,
“our good knight gives us a proof of what he is; the curds
i’ faith have softened his skull and mellowed his brain.”</p>
<p>Here Sancho came up to him, and exclaimed, “For
God’s sake, sir, mind that my master, Don Quixote, does
not fight with these lions, for if he fights them all we here
will be torn to pieces.”</p>
<p>“But is your master so mad,” the gentleman answered,
“that you fear and believe that he will fight with animals
so fierce?”</p>
<p>“Not mad is he,” replied Sancho,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span> “but headstrong.”</p>
<p>“I will make him desist,” said the gentleman. And
coming up to Don Quixote, who was pressing the keeper
to open the cage, he said, “Sir Knight, Knights Errant
have to engage in adventures which hold out some prospect
of a good issue from them, and not in those that are wholly
devoid of it, for the valour which enters within the bounds
of temerity has more of madness than of fortitude; moreover,
these lions come not against you, nor do they dream
of doing so, but are going as a present to his Majesty, and
it will not be right to detain them or hinder their journey.”</p>
<p>“Get you gone, Sir Country-squire,” replied Don
Quixote, “and look after your quiet pointer and your
saucy ferret, and leave every one to do his duty; this is
mine, and I know whether they come against me or not,
these gentlemen the lions.” And, turning to the keeper, he
said, “I swear, Don Rascal, that if you do not open the
cage at once, instantly, I will pin you to the cart with this
lance.”</p>
<p>The carter, seeing that armed phantom’s determination,
said to him—</p>
<p>“Be pleased, dear sir, for charity, to let me unyoke the
mules and place myself and them in safety before the lions
are let loose, for if they are killed I shall be utterly ruined,
for I have no other property but this cart and these
mules.”</p>
<p>“O man of little faith!” replied Don Quixote, “get
down and unyoke, and do what thou wilt, for soon thou
shalt see that thou toilest in vain, and might spare thyself
these pains.”</p>
<p>The carter alighted and in great haste unyoked, and the
keeper cried in a loud voice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span> “Be witnesses as many as are
here, how against my will and on compulsion I open the
cages and let loose the lions, and that I protest to this
gentleman, that all the evil and damage these beasts shall
do will run and go to his account, with my wages and dues
besides. Let you, sirs, make yourselves safe before I open;
for myself, I am sure they will do me no harm.”</p>
<p>Once more Don Diego entreated him not to commit such
an act of madness, for to engage in such a freak were a
tempting of Providence, to which Don Quixote replied that
he knew what he was doing. The gentleman pressed him
again to look well to it, for that he was surely mistaken.</p>
<p>“Nay, sir,” quoth Don Quixote, “if your worship would
not bear witness to this, which in your opinion is about to
be a tragedy, spur your grey and put yourself in safety.”</p>
<p>Sancho, on hearing this, prayed his master with tears in
his eyes to desist from such an enterprise, compared to
which that of the windmills, and the fearful one of the
fulling-mills, and, in short, all the deeds his master had
attempted in the course of his life, were but pleasuring and
junketing.</p>
<p>“Look, sir,” quoth Sancho, “here there is no enchantment,
nor anything like it, for I have seen through the
chinks and bars of the cage a claw of a real lion, and I
gather from it that such a lion, to have such a claw, is
bigger than a mountain.”</p>
<p>“Fear, at least,” said Don Quixote, “will make it seem
bigger to thee than half the earth. Retire, Sancho, and
leave me, and if I die here, thou knowest our old compact:
thou wilt betake thee to Dulcinea. I say no more.”</p>
<p>Other words he added to these which took away all hope
of his giving up proceeding with his insane purpose. He
of the Green Coat would have resisted him in it, but he
saw himself unequal in arms, and judged it not wise to
fight with a madman, for such he now appeared to him to
be at all points. Don Quixote once more pressing the
keeper and repeating his threats, caused the gentleman
to urge his mare, and Sancho Dapple, and the carter his
mules, all trying to get away from the cart as far as possible
before the lions broke loose. Sancho wept over the death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
of his master, for this time he verily believed it had come
from the lion’s claws; he cursed his fortune and called it a
fatal hour when it came into his mind once more to serve
Don Quixote; but none the less, in weeping and lamenting,
did he stop cudgelling Dapple to get him farther from
the cart. The lion-keeper, seeing now that those who had
fled were well away, again entreated and warned Don
Quixote as he had entreated and warned him before, but
the Knight replied that he heard him, and that he cared
for no more warnings and entreaties, which would be fruitless,
and bade him despatch. Whilst the keeper was
engaged in opening the first cage, Don Quixote was considering
whether it would be better to have the battle on
foot or on horseback, and finally he decided to have it on foot,
fearing lest Rozinante should be startled at the sight of the
lions. Therefore, he leapt from his horse, threw away his
lance, and buckling his shield and unsheathing his sword,
leisurely, with a marvellous intrepidity and valiant heart
advanced to post himself in front of the cart, commending
his soul to God and then to his lady Dulcinea.</p>
<p>And it is to be known that, coming to this passage, the
author of this truthful history breaks out into this exclamation,
saying—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>
<p>“O brave and beyond all commendation courageous
Don Quixote of La Mancha! mirror wherein all the valiant
may behold themselves, a second and new Don Manuel de
Leon, who was the honour and glory of Spanish Knights!
In what words shall I recount this dread exploit, or by what
argument make it creditable to future ages? What praises
can there be unfitting and unmeet for thee, be they ever
such hyperboles upon hyperboles? Thou on foot, thou
alone, thou fearless, thou great-hearted, with thy simple
sword, and that not one of your trenchant dog blades;
with a shield of no very bright and shining steel, standest
watching and waiting for two of the fiercest lions that ever
the African forests engendered! Let thy deeds themselves,
valorous Manchegan, extol thee, for here I leave them at
their height, failing words to glorify them.”</p>

<div class="caption">“HE PUT HIS HEAD OUT OF THE CAGE AND GAZED ALL ABOUT WITH HIS
EYES BLAZING LIKE LIVE COALS.”</div>
</div>
<p>Here the author breaks off from his apostrophe, and
proceeds to take up the thread of his history, saying—</p>
<p>The keeper, seeing Don Quixote fixed in his position,
and that it was impossible to avoid letting loose the male
lion without falling under the resentment of the rageful and
dauntless Knight, opened wide the door of the first cage
where, as has been said, was the male lion, who looked to
be of extraordinary size and of a hideous and terrible aspect.
The first thing he did was to turn himself round in his
cage, and to extend his claws and stretch himself to his full
length. Then he opened his mouth and yawned very
leisurely, and with about two hands’-breadth of tongue
which he put out, he licked the dust from his eyes and
bathed his face. This done, he put his head out of the
cage and gazed all about with his eyes blazing like live
coals, a spectacle and attitude to instil dread into daring
itself. Don Quixote alone looked at him intently,
longing for him to leap out of the cart and come within
reach of his hands, between which he thought to rend
him to pieces.</p>
<p>To this height did his unheard-of madness carry him;
but the generous lion, more courteous than arrogant,
taking no notice of these childish tricks and swaggerings,
after having looked round about him, as has been said,
turned his back and, showing to Don Quixote his hinder
parts, with great calmness and nonchalance flung himself
down again in the cage. Seeing this Don Quixote commanded
him to give him some blows and tease him so that
he might come out.</p>
<p>“That I will not do,” answered the keeper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span> “for if I excite
him the first he will tear in pieces will be myself. Let
your worship, Sir Knight, be content with what has been
done, which is all that one can tell of in point of valour,
and seek not to tempt fortune a second time. The lion
has his door open; it rests with him to come out or not;
but since he has not come out up to now he will not come
out all day. Your worship’s greatness of heart is now
made fully manifest. No champion fighter, as I take it, is
bound to do more than defy his enemy and wait for him in
the field; if the opponent does not appear the infamy rests
upon him, and he who waits wins the crown of victory.”</p>
<p>“That is true,” said Don Quixote; “close the door,
friend, and give in the best form thou canst a voucher of
what thou hast seen me do: to wit, how that thou didst open
to the lion; I awaited him; he did not come out; I waited
for him again; again he did not come out, but turned to lie
down. I am bound to do no more. Enchantments avaunt!
and God prosper justice and truth and true chivalry! Shut
the door, friend, whilst I signal to the fugitive and absent
to return that they may learn of this exploit from thy
mouth.”</p>
<p>The keeper did so, and Don Quixote, placing on the
point of his lance the cloth with which he had wiped the
shower of curds off his face, began to hail those who had
never ceased retreating all in a troop, looking round at
every step, driven before him by the gentlemen in Green.
Sancho happened to perceive the signal of the white cloth,
and exclaimed, “May I die if my master has not conquered
the wild beasts, for he is calling us!”</p>
<p>They all stopped, and seeing that it was Don Quixote
who was making the signals, losing some of their fear, little
by little they came nearer, until they clearly heard the
voice of Don Quixote calling to them.</p>
<p>At length they returned to the cart, and on their approach
Don Quixote said to the carter—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>
<p>“Yoke your mules again, friend, and proceed on your
journey, and thou, Sancho, give him two gold crowns for
himself and for the keeper, towards amends for my having
detained them.”</p>
<p>“I will give them with all my heart,” answered Sancho;
“but what has been done with the lions? Are they dead
or alive?”</p>
<p>Then the keeper recounted minutely and at his leisure
the issue of the encounter, extolling, to the best of his
power and skill, the valour of Don Quixote, at sight of
whom the cowed lion cared not, or durst not, to come out
of his cage, though he had held the door open a good
while, and that it was through his having told the Knight
that it was a tempting of Providence to provoke the lion so
as to force him to come out, as he wanted him to do, that
he had most unwillingly and against the grain permitted
him to close the door.”</p>
<p>“What is your judgment on this, Sancho?” quoth Don
Quixote; “are there enchantments which avail against
true valour? The enchanters may be able to rob me
indeed of fortune, but of my resolution and courage, it is
impossible.”</p>
<p>Sancho gave the gold crowns; the carter yoked up; the
keeper kissed Don Quixote’s hands for the largess received,
and promised to relate that valorous deed to the King
himself when he should see him at Court.</p>
<p>“And if by chance his Majesty should ask who performed
it,” said Don Quixote, “you shall tell him, <i>The Knight of
the Lions</i>; for henceforth I would that into this may be
changed, altered, varied, and transferred, the name which
till now I have borne, of the Knight of the Rueful Feature;
and in this I follow the ancient usage of Knights Errant,
who changed their names at their pleasure and according to
the occasion.”</p>
<p>The cart proceeded on its journey, and Don Quixote.
Sancho, and he of the Green Coat, continued theirs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>
<p class="center small"><i>Of the strange adventures which happened to Don Quixote in the Castle.</i></p>
<p>... With this she began to touch a harp very softly.</p>
<p>On hearing this Don Quixote was startled, for in that
moment there came into his memory the infinite adventures
similar to that, of windows, lattices, and gardens; of serenades,
love-plaints, and languishments, which he had read
of in his giddy books of chivalries. He at once conceived
that some one of the Duchess’s maidens was enamoured of
him, and that modesty compelled her to keep her love in
secret. He trembled lest he should yield, but resolved in
his mind not to let himself be overcome; so, commending
himself with all good heart and soul to his lady Dulcinea
del Toboso, he determined to listen to the music; and to
let them know he was there, he feigned to sneeze, at which
the damsels were not a little rejoiced, for they desired
nothing better than that Don Quixote should hear them.
Then, the harp being set up and tuned, Altisidora struck up
this ballad—</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here ended the lay of the sore-wounded Altisidora, and
here began the terror of the courted Don Quixote, who,
heaving a deep sigh, said to himself—</p>
<p>“How unhappy an Errant am I, that there is no maiden
but looks upon me, who is not enamoured of me! How
sad is the fate of the peerless Dulcinea, whom they will not
leave free to enjoy my incomparable fidelity! Queens,
what do ye want of her? Empresses, why do ye persecute
her? Maidens of fourteen and fifteen, wherefore do ye
molest her? Leave, O leave the unhappy one to triumph,
to rejoice, to glory in the lot which love would assign her in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
the rendering her my heart, and delivering to her my soul!
Know, ye amorous crew, that for Dulcinea alone am
I dough and sugar-paste, and for all the rest of you flint.
For her I am honey, and for you aloes. For me Dulcinea
alone is the beautiful, the sensible, the chaste, the gay, and
the well-bred; and the rest ugly, silly, wanton and base-born.
To be her’s and none other’s Nature sent me into
the world. Let Altisidora weep or sing; let the lady
despair for whose sake they belaboured me in the castle of
the enchanted Moor; for Dulcinea’s I must be—roasted or
boiled, clean, well-born, and chaste—in spite of all the
powers of witchcraft in the world.”</p>
<p>And with that he clapt the window to, and laid down on
his bed; where for the present we will leave him, for the
great Sancho calls, who is desirous of making a beginning
with his famous Governorship.</p>
<p class="center small"><i>Of the mode in which the great Sancho Panza began to govern, when he
had taken possession of his Isle.</i></p>
<p>... At this moment there entered the justice-hall two
men, one dressed as a labourer and the other as a tailor, for
he bore a pair of scissors in his hand, and the tailor said—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>
<p>“Sir Governor, I and this labouring man have come
before your worship for the cause that this good fellow came
to my shop yesterday, who, saving your presences, am a
licensed tailor, blessed be God! and putting a piece of
cloth in my hands, asked me: ‘Sir, would there be enough
in this cloth to make me a cap?’I, measuring the stuff,
answered him ‘<i>Yes</i>.’He must have suspected, as I
suspect, and suspected rightly, that without doubt I wished
to rob him of some part of his cloth, founding his belief on
his own roguery and the ill-opinion there is of tailors, and
he replied that I should look and see if there were enough
for two. I guessed his drift, and said, ‘<i>Yes</i>’ and he, riding
away on his first damned intent, went on adding caps, and
I adding <i>yeses</i>, till we reached five caps; and now at this
moment he has come for them, and I am giving them to
him; and he will not pay me for the making, but rather
demands that I shall pay him, or give him back his cloth.”</p>
<p>“Is all this so, brother?” inquired Sancho.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir,” answered the man; “but let your worship
make him show the five caps he has made me.”</p>
<p>“With all my heart,” said the tailor, and thrusting his
hand suddenly under his cloak he showed five caps on it,
placed on the five tops of his fingers, and said: “Here are
the five caps which this good man wants of me, and on God
and my conscience I have none of the cloth left for myself,
and I will give the work to be examined by the inspectors
of the trade.”</p>
<p>All those present laughed at the number of caps, and at
the novelty of the suit. Sancho set himself to consider a
little while, and then said—</p>
<p>“Methinks there need be no long delays in this case, but
that it may be decided, according to a wise mans’ judgment,
off-hand; and so I decree that the tailor shall lose
the making, and the countryman the stuff, the caps to be
given to the prisoners in the gaol; and let no more
be said.”</p>
<p>This judgment provoked the laughter of the audience,
but what the Governor commanded was done.</p>
<p class="center small"><i>Of how Don Quixote fell sick, and of the will he made, and of his death.</i></p>
<p>... The Notary entered with the rest, and after having
written the preamble to the will, and Don Quixote had disposed
of his soul with all those Christian circumstances which
are requisite, coming to the bequests he said—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>
<p>“<i>Item, it is my will that of certain moneys which Sancho
Panza, whom in my madness I made my squire, retains, that
because there have been between him and me certain accounts,
receipts, and disbursements, I wish that he be not charged with
them, nor that any reckoning be asked from him, but that, if
there should be any surplus after he has paid himself what I
owe him, the residue should be his, which will be very little,
and may it do him much good. And if I, being mad, was a
party to giving him the governorship of the Isle, now, being
sane, I would give him that of a Kingdom, were I able, for the
simplicity of his nature and the fidelity of his behaviour
deserve it.</i>”</p>
<p>And turning to Sancho, he said to him—</p>
<p>“Pardon me, friend, that I have given thee occasion to
appear mad like myself, making thee fall into the error into
which I fell, that there were and are Knights Errant in the
world.”</p>
<p>“Alack!” responded Sancho, weeping, “don’t you die,
your worship, dear master, but take my advice and live
many years, for the maddest thing a man can do in this
life is to let himself die without more ado, without anybody
killing him, nor other hands to finish him off than those of
melancholy. Look you, do not be lazy, but get out of that
bed, and we will go into the country, dressed like shepherds,
as we have arranged. Mayhap behind some hedge we shall
find the lady Donna Dulcinea disenchanted, and as fine as
may be seen. If so be that you are dying of fretting at
being conquered, put the fault on me, and say they overthrew
you because I girthed Rozinante badly; more by token,
as your worship must have seen in your books of chivalries,
that it was a common thing for some Knights to overthrow
others, and he who is conquered to-day may be conqueror
to-morrow.”</p>
<p>“It is so,” said Samson, “and honest Sancho is very true
about these matters.”</p>
<p>“Gently, sirs,” said Don Quixote,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span> “for <i>in last  year’s
nests you look not for birds of this year</i>. I was mad, and
now I am sane. I was Don Quixote of La Mancha, and
to-day I am, as I have said, Alonso Quixano the Good.
May my repentance and my sincerity restore me to the
esteem you once had for me, and so let Master Notary go on.”</p>
<p>“<i>Item, I bequeath all my estate, without reserve, to Antonia
Quixana, my Niece, who is present, there being first deducted
from it, as may be most convenient, what is needed for the
satisfaction of the bequests which I have made; and the first
payment to be made I desire to be of the salary due to my Housekeeper
from the time she has been in my service, with twenty
ducats more for a dress. I leave as my executors Master
Priest, and Master Bachelor Samson Carrasco, who are present.
Item, it is my wish that if Antonia Quixana, my Niece, is
inclined to marry, she should wed a man of whom she shall
first have evidence that he knows not what books of chivalries
are; and in case it shall be discovered that he does know,
and yet my Niece wishes to marry with him and does so marry,
that she shall forfeit all that I have bequeathed her, which my
executors are empowered to distribute in pious works at their
pleasure. Item, I beseech the said gentlemen, my executors,
that if good fortune should bring them to know the author
who, they say, wrote a history which is current hereabout
under the title of Second Part of the Exploits of Don Quixote
of La Mancha, that they will on my behalf beg him, as
earnestly as they can, to pardon the occasion which I unwittingly
gave him for writing so many and such enormous
follies as therein be written, for I quit this life with some
tenderness of conscience for having given him a motive for
writing them.</i>”</p>
<p>With this he concluded his testament, and, being taken
with a fainting fit, he lay extended at full length upon the
bed. They were all alarmed, and ran to his assistance, and
during the three days that he lived after the day on which
he made his will he fainted very frequently. The house
was all in confusion; however, the Niece ate, the Housekeeper
drank, and Sancho Panza was cheerful; for this
inheriting of something dulls or tempers in the inheritor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
the memory of the pain which the dead man naturally
leaves behind.</p>
<p>At last came Don Quixote’s end, after he had received all
the sacraments, and after he had expressed with many and
moving terms his horror at the books of chivalries. The
Notary was present, and said that never had he read in any
book of chivalries that any Knight Errant had died in his
bed so tranquilly and so Christianlike as Don Quixote,
who, amidst the tears and lamentations of all who stood by,
gave up his spirit,—that is to say, died.</p>
<p>On seeing this, the Priest asked the Notary to give him a
certificate that Alonso Quixano the Good, commonly
called Don Quixote of La Mancha, had passed out of this
present life, and had died a natural death; declaring that
he sought such certificate in order to take away from any
other author than Cid Hamet Benengeli the excuse falsely to
resuscitate him, and write interminable histories of his deeds.</p>
<p>This was the end of the Ingenious Gentleman of La
Mancha, whose village Cid Hamet desired not to indicate
precisely, in order to let all the cities and towns of La
Mancha contend among themselves for the honour of giving
him birth and adopting him for their own, as the seven
cities of Greece contended for Homer. The lamentations
of Sancho, of the Niece, and the Housekeeper of Don
Quixote are here omitted, as well as the new epitaphs upon
his tomb; but this was what Samson Carrasco put there:—</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">I<span class="smcap">t</span> happened afterwards, dear reader, that as two of my
friends and myself were coming from Esquivias, a
place famous for twenty reasons, more especially for its
illustrious families and for its excellent wines, I heard a man
behind me whipping his nag with all his might, and
seemingly very desirous of overtaking us. Presently he
called out to us, and begged us to stop, which we did; and
when he came up, he turned out to be a country student,
dressed in brown, with spatterdashes and round-toed shoes.
He had a sword in a huge sheath, and a band tied with
tape. He had indeed but two tapes, so that his band got
out of its place, which he took great pains to rectify.
“Doubtless,” said he, “Señors, you are in quest of some
office or some prebendal stall at the court of my Lord of
Toledo, or from the King, if I may judge from the celerity
with which you journey; for, in good truth, my ass has
hitherto had the fame of a good trotter, and yet he could
not overtake you.”</p>
<p>One of my companions answered, “It is the stout steed
of Señor Miguel Cervantes that is the cause of it, for he is
very quick in his paces.”</p>
<p>Scarcely had the student heard the name of Cervantes,
than, throwing himself off his ass, whilst his cloak-bag
tumbled on one side and his portmanteau on the other, and
his bands covered his face, he sprang towards me, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
seizing me by the left hand, exclaimed: “This, then, is
the famous one-handed author, the merriest of writers, the
favourite of the Muses.”</p>
<p>As for me, when I heard him pouring forth all these
praises, I thought myself obliged in politeness to answer
him; so embracing his neck, whereby I contrived to pull
off his bands altogether, I said: “I am indeed Cervantes,
Señor, but not the favourite of the Muses, nor any other of
those fine things which you have said of me. Pray, sir,
mount your ass again, and let us converse together for the
small remainder of our journey.”</p>
<p>The good student did as I desired. We then drew bit,
and proceeded at a more moderate pace. As we rode on,
we talked of my illness, but the student gave me little hope,
saying: “It is an hydropsy, which all the water in the
ocean, if you could drink it, would not cure; you must
drink less, Señor Cervantes, and not neglect to eat, for this
alone can cure you.”</p>
<p>“Many other people,” said I, “have told me the same
thing; but it is as impossible for me not to drink, as if I
had been born for nothing but drinking. My life is pretty
nearly ended, and to judge by the quickness of my pulse,
I cannot live longer than next Sunday. You have made
acquaintance with me at a very unfortunate time, as I fear
that I shall not live to show my gratitude to you for your
obliging conduct.”</p>
<p>Such was our conversation when we arrived at the bridge
of Toledo, over which I was to pass, while he was bound
another route by the bridge of Segovia.</p>
<p>“As to my future history, I leave that to the care of
fame. My friends will, no doubt, be very anxious to narrate
it, and I should have great pleasure in hearing it.”</p>
<p>I embraced him anew, and repeated the offer of my
services. He spurred his ass and left me as ill inclined to
prosecute my journey, as he was well disposed to do so.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
He had, however, supplied my pen with ample materials for
pleasantry. But all times are not the same. Perhaps the
time may yet arrive when, taking up the thread which I am
now compelled to break, I may complete what is now
wanting, and what I fain would tell. But adieu to gaiety,
adieu to humour, adieu, my pleasant friends! I must now
die, and I wish for nothing better than speedily to see
you well contented in another world.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">hat</span> young creature whom you see there,” said the
God of Love, as he led me on, “is the chief captain
of my war, the one that has brought most men under my
banners. The elderly person that is leading her along by
the hand is her aunt.”</p>
<p>“Her <i>aunt</i>, did you say?” I replied; “her <i>aunt</i>? Then
there is an end of all my love for her. That word ‘<i>aunt</i>’is
a counter-poison that has disinfected me entirely, and quite
healed the wound your well-planted arrow was beginning
to make in my heart. For, however much a man may be
in love, there can be no doubt an <i>aunt</i> will always be
enough to purge him clean of it. Inquisitive, suspicious,
envious,—one or the other she cannot fail to be,—and if
the niece have the luck to escape, the lover never has; for
if she is envious, she wants him for herself; and if she is
only suspicious, she still spoils all comfort, so disconcerting
every little project, and so disturbing every little nice plan,
as to render pleasure itself unsavoury.”</p>
<p>“Why, what a desperately bad opinion you have of
aunts?” said Love.</p>
<p>“To be sure I have,” said I. “If the state of innocence
in which Adam and Eve were created had nothing else to
recommend it, the simple fact that there could have been
no <i>aunts</i> in Paradise would have been enough for me.
Why, every morning, as soon as I get up, I cross myself and
say, ‘By the sign of the Holy Rood, from all aunts deliver
us this day, good Lord.’And every time I repeat the
<i>Pater Noster</i>, after ‘Lead us not into temptation,’I always
add, ‘nor into the way of aunts either.’”</p>

</div>
<p>In this edifying manner did Don Marcos arrive at the
age of thirty, with the reputation of a wealthy man;
and with good reason, for he had gathered together, at the
expense of every gentlemanly quality, and the starvation of
his unfortunate carcase, a good round sum, which he always
retained near him, for he dreaded every kind of speculation
that might place in the slightest degree of jeopardy his
darling treasure.</p>
<p>Now as Don Marcos was known to be neither a gambler
nor a libertine, good opportunities of marriage continually
presented themselves, of which, however, he did not avail
himself always, considering it a speculation, and not unlikely
to lead to some unfortunate result. Nevertheless,
he wished to appear to advantage in the eyes of the ladies,
some of whom, not knowing him, might have no objection
to him as a husband. To them he appeared more in the
light of a gallant than a miser. Amongst others who would
have no objection to him, was a lady who had been married,
but was not so well reconciled to her situation as a widow.</p>
<p>She was a lady of superior air and pretentions, although
somewhat past the prime of life; but by the help of a little
study and skill, no one would have supposed that she had
arrived at so discreet an age as she certainly had. She was
prettily enough called Donna Isidora, and was reported to
be very rich; that she had actual property, at least according
to those who knew her well, her manner of living clearly
enough proved. Now this eligible match was proposed to
Don Marcos; the lady was represented to him in such
engaging colours, with such perfect assurance that she
possessed more than fourteen or fifteen thousand ducats,
that he was led into temptation—the temptation of Mammon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
Her deceased husband was represented to have been
a gentleman of one of the best families of Andalusia, and
Donna Isidora was equally well born, and a native of the
famous city of Seville.</p>
<p>These flattering communications so worked on the avarice
and pride of our friend Don Marcos, that he almost wished
himself already married, that he might be sure of the
possession of so enviable a prize. He who first entangled
Don Marcos in this notable affair was a cunning rogue of
a dealer, who not only dealt in marriages, but in other
descriptions of more sure traffic.</p>
<p>He promised therefore an introduction to Don Marcos
that very evening, because, as he said, there was danger in
delay.</p>
<p>Donna Isidora was profuse in her thanks to the obliging
gentleman who had procured her the pleasure of such an
acquaintance; and she finally established her triumph over
Don Marcos, by inviting him to a costly entertainment,
wherein she displayed the utmost luxury and wealth.</p>
<p>At this entertainment Don Marcos was introduced to
a young man of a very gallant and prepossessing appearance,
whom Donna Isidora honoured with the title of nephew.
His name was Augustin, and he, in turn, seemed happy in
the chance that gave him so delightful a relationship. The
under servant, Ines, waited on them at table, because
Marcella, the upper maid, by the order of her mistress,
was engaged to entertain them with her guitar, in the
management of which she was so perfect, that even the
grandees of the court were seldom regaled with better
music. Her voice, which she accompanied with the
instrument, was so melodious, that it appeared more like
that of an angel than a woman. The unaffected manner,
too, without the slightest timidity, yet equally free from
boldness, in which she sung, lent an additional charm; for
without being entreated, she continued to amuse them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
feeling confident that her performance would be well
received.</p>
<p>Don Marcos felt himself so completely at ease with the
well-bred, though generous hospitality of Donna Isidora
and her nephew, that without the least scruple he amply
indemnified himself for many a hungry day, as the sensible
diminution of the luxuries of the table bore abundant, or
rather scanty testimony. It may be said without exaggeration,
that that evening’s entertainment furnished him with
as much as six days of his ordinary consumption; and the
continual and repeated supplies, forced on him by his
elegant and kind hostess, were in themselves sufficient to
enable him to dispense with eating for a considerable time
to come.</p>
<p>The pleasures of the conversation and of the table finished
with the daylight, and four wax candles were placed in
beautiful candelabras, by the light of which, and the sounds
which Augustin drew from the instrument which Marcella
had before touched so well, the two girls commenced a
dance, in which they moved with such grace, as to excite
the admiration of their superiors. After all this, Marcella,
at the request of Don Marcos, again took her guitar, and
closed the evening’s amusement with an old chivalric
romance.</p>
<p>On the conclusion of the song, the gentleman who had
introduced Don Marcos gave him a hint that it was time
to retire; who, though unwilling to leave such good company,
and such good cheer, and at such little cost, took leave of
his kind hostess with expressions of consideration and
friendship, and took his road homewards, entertaining his
friend by the way with expressions of admiration of Donna
Isidora, or rather, more properly speaking, of her money.
He begged him as soon as possible to have a deed drawn
up which would ensure to him so enviable a treasure. His
friend replied that he might already consider the marriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
concluded, for that his opinion held such weight with Donna
Isidora, that he would take an early opportunity of speaking
with her to effect the arrangement, for he fully agreed with
him, that delays were dangerous.</p>
<p>With this excellent maxim they separated, the one to
recount to Donna Isidora what had passed, and the other
to return to the house of his master.</p>
<p>It being very late, all the household had retired to rest.
Don Marcos availing himself of the end of a candle, which
he generally carried in his pocket for the purpose, withdrew
to a small lamp, which lighted an image of the Virgin, at
the corner of the street. There he placed it on the point
of his sword and lighted it, making, at the same time, a
very short but devout prayer that the very reasonable hopes
he had framed might not be disappointed. Satisfied with
this pious duty, he then retired to rest, waiting, however,
impatiently for the day which should crown his expectations.</p>
<p>The next day he was visited by his friend Gamorre, such
was the name of the gentleman who had recommended to
him this tempting alliance. Don Marcos had risen by
times that morning, for love and interest had conspired to
banish sleep from his pillow. It was, therefore, with the
utmost joy that he welcomed his visitor, who informed him
that he had been successful in his mission to Donna Isidora,
and that he was the bearer of an invitation to him from that
lady to pass the day at her house, when he would have an
opportunity of personally pressing his suit, and perhaps
concluding the negociation which had so happily commenced.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Before they parted that night everything was arranged
for their marriage, which in three days from that time
was solemnised with all the splendour becoming people of
rank and wealth. Don Marcos on this occasion so far
overcame his parsimony as to present his wife with a rich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
wedding dress of great cost and fashion; calculating very
wisely that the expense was but trifling in comparison with
what he had to receive.</p>
<p>Behold, then, our friend Don Marcos, lord and master of
this sumptuous dwelling, and its amiable inmates; and
when the day of the auspicious union arrived, it found
him in a state of the greatest possible contentment and
happiness.</p>
<p>“Surely this is the happiest day of my life,” he said to
himself. The future domestic arrangements were all carefully
discussed by the calculating mind of the bridegroom;
and he already had disposed of his anticipated savings in a
speculation; for he had begun even to think of speculating
as to the greatest saving and profit.</p>
<p>Before retiring to rest, however, these flattering visions
were a little disturbed by the sudden illness of Augustin.
Whether it proceeded from mortification at his aunt’s
wedding, which threatened to curtail him of some of his
fair proportions—his accustomed pleasures, or from some
natural cause, it is impossible to say; but the house was
suddenly thrown into a state of the greatest confusion;
servants running about for remedies, and Donna Isidora in
a state of the most violent agitation! However, the invalid
became composed with the efforts which were made in his
behalf; and Donna Isidora ventured to leave him and retire
to rest, while the bridegroom went his round, taking care
to see that the doors and windows were all fast, possessing
himself of the keys for their better security.</p>
<p>This last act of caution seemed to be looked on with
great distrust by the servants, who immediately attributed
to jealousy that which was the result only of care and
prudence; for Don Marcos had that morning removed to
the house, with his own valuable person, and all his worldly
possessions, including his six thousand ducats, which had
not for a long time seen the light of day, and which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
intended should still be consigned to solitary confinement,
as far as locks and keys would ensure it.</p>
<p>Having arranged everything to his satisfaction, he retired
to his bridal-chamber, leaving the servants to bewail their
unhappy fortune, in having got a master whose habits
threatened to curtail them of little liberties which the
kindness of their mistress had so long indulged. Marcella
spoke of her dissatisfaction at once; saying that rather than
live like a nun, she should seek her fortune elsewhere, but
Ines fancying that she heard a noise in the chamber of Don
Augustin, and feeling he might require something in his
illness, stepped lightly to his room to inquire in what she
might assist him.</p>
<p>On the ensuing morning Ines was about the house
earlier than usual, and to her surprise found the chamber
of Marcella empty, and no appearance of her having slept
there that night. Astonished at so strange a circumstance,
she left the room to seek her, and was still more surprised
on finding the outer door unlocked, which her master had
so carefully fastened the night before, and which now, as
if for the purpose of disturbing Don Marcos’s ideas of
security, had been left wide open.</p>
<p>On seeing this, Ines became terribly alarmed, and flew to
the chamber of her mistress, raising an outcry that the
house had been broken into. The bridegroom, half stupified
with terror, leaped from the couch, calling for his wife
to do the same; at the same time drawing aside all the
curtains, and throwing open all the windows, in order that
there might be no deficiency of light to see whether anything
were missing. The first thing he beheld was what he
supposed to be his wife, but so altered, that he could scarce
believe her to be the same; instead of six-and-thirty years
of age, which she professed to be, this sudden and unwelcome
visitation of morning light added at least twenty
years to her appearance; small locks of grey hair peeped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
from beneath her nightcap, which had been carefully concealed
by the art of the hair-dresser, but the false hair had
in the carelessness of sleep been unluckily transferred to the
ground.</p>
<p>The suddenness of this morning’s alarm had produced
another no less unfortunate mischance; her teeth, which
Don Marcos had so complimented for their regularity and
whiteness, were now, alas! not to be seen, and the lady at
least verified the old proverb of not casting pearls before
swine. We will not attempt to describe the consternation
of the poor hidalgo, or waste words which the imagination
can so much better supply. We will only say that Donna
Isidora was confounded. It was intolerable that her imperfections
should be made thus manifest at so unseasonable
an hour, and snatching up her strayed locks, she attempted
to replace them, but with such little success, owing to her
extreme hurry, that had not Don Marcos been overwhelmed
with consternation, he would assuredly hardly have refrained
from laughter. She then sought to lay hands on the dress
she had worn the previous day; but, alas! nothing of the
rich paraphernalia in which she had been attired by the
gallantry of her husband—not one of the jewels and trinkets
in which she had dazzled the spectators’ eyes—remained.</p>
<p>Don Marcos, on his part, was struck dumb with horror,
on finding that his own wedding suit was missing, and
likewise a valuable gold chain which he had worn at the
ceremony, and which he had drawn from his treasure for
the purpose. No pen can describe the agony of Don
Marcos upon this fatal discovery; he could not even
console himself with the youthful graces of his wife, for
turning towards her he saw nothing but age and ugliness,
and turning his eyes again from her, he found his expensive
clothes all vanished, and his chain gone.</p>
<p>Almost out of his wits, he ran out into the saloon, and
throughout the apartments, attired only in his shirt, wringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
his hands, and betraying every sign of a miser’s lamentation
and despair. While in this mood, Donna Isidora
escaped to her dressing-room, without giving herself the
trouble of inquiring into the minor catastrophe, and busied
herself in repairing the personal injuries which the untoward
event had produced. Don Augustin had by this time
risen, and Ines recounted to him the adventures of the
morning, and they both laughed heartily at the consternation
of poor Don Marcos, the ridiculous accident of Donna
Isidora, and the roguishness of Marcella.</p>

<p>“I could do with some money, but I’m not in want of
ancestors,” replied the student. So they continued their
adventures.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">H<span class="smcap">omer</span>, we find, represents Jupiter as the author or
inspirer of dreams, more especially the dreams of
princes and governors, granting always that the subject of
them be of a religious and important character. It is
stated, moreover, as the opinion of the learned Propertius,
“that good dreams are sent from above, have their meaning,
and ought not to be slighted.” To give frankly my
own idea upon this subject, I am inclined to his way of
thinking, in particular as to the case of a certain dream
I had the other night. As I was reading a sermon concerning
the end of the world, it happened that I fell asleep
over it, and pursuing the same line of thought, dreamed
the following dream of the Last Judgment—a thing rarely
admitted into the house of a poet, so much as in a dream.
I was in this way reminded too of an observation in
“Claudian,” “that all creatures dream at night of what they
have heard and seen in the day; as the hound,” says
Petronius Arbiter, “dreams of hunting the hare.”</p>
<p>Well, methought I beheld a noble-looking youth towering
in the air, and drawing loud and solemn tones from a
mighty trumpet. The vehemence of his breath did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
certainly detract somewhat from the effect of his glorious
beauty, yet even the monumental marbles, the earth-closed
caverns—nay, the very dead within—obeyed his fearful call;
for the ground was seen gradually to open, the bones to
rise and unite together, and a mighty harvest of the living
spring from the long-sown seed of the dead. The first
that appeared were soldiers,—such as generals of armies,
captains, lieutenants, and the common foot, who, thinking
that a fresh charge had sounded, rose out of their graves
with considerable boldness and alacrity, as if they had
been preparing for combat, or a sudden assault. The
misers next put their heads out, all pale and trembling,
with the idea they were going to be again plundered.
Cavaliers and boon companions came trooping along,
supposing they were going to a horse-race, or a grand
hunt. In short, though all heard the trumpet sound, not
any one seemed to understand it, for their thoughts were
plain enough to be read by the strangeness of their looks
and gestures.</p>
<p>While the souls came trooping in on all sides, many
were seen to approach their new bodies, not without signs
of considerable aversion and difficulty. Others stood spellbound
with wonder and horror, as if not venturing to come
nearer to so dreadful a spectacle; for this wanted an arm,
that an eye, and the other a head. Though, on the whole,
I could not forbear smiling at so strange a variety of figures,
I found yet greater matter for awe and admiration at the
power of Providence, which drew order out of chaos, and
restored every part and member to its particular owner.
I dreamed that I was myself in a churchyard; that I saw
numbers busied in changing heads, who were averse to
make their appearance; and an attorney would have put
in a demurrer, on the plea that he had got a soul that could
be none of his, for that his soul and body belonged to some
different ones elsewhere.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>
<p>When it came at length to be generally understood that
here at last was the Day of Judgment, it was curious to
observe what strange evasions and excuses were made use
of among the wicked. The man of pleasure, the betrayer
of innocence, the epicure, and the hypocrite, would not
own their eyes, nor the slanderer his tongue, because they
were sure to appear in evidence against them. Pick-pockets
were seen running away as fast as possible from
their own fingers, while an old usurer wandered about
anxiously inquiring if the money-bags were not to rise as
well as the bodies? I should have laughed outright at this,
had not my attention been called away to a throng of cutpurses,
hastening all speed from their own ears, now offered
them, that they might not hear so many sad stories against
themselves.</p>
<p>I was a witness to the whole scene, from a convenient
station above it, when all at once there was uttered a loud
outcry at my feet of “Withdraw, withdraw!” No sooner
was it pronounced, than down I came, and forthwith a
number of handsome women put out their heads and called
me a base clown for not showing the respect and courtesy
due to their high quality, not being a whit the less inclined
to stand upon their etiquette,—although in Hell itself.
They appeared half-naked, and as proud as Juno’s peacock,
whenever they happened to catch your eye; and, to say
truth, they had a good complexion, and were well made.
When they were informed, however, that it was no other
than the Day of Judgment, they took the alarm, all their
vivacity vanished, and slowly they took their way towards
an adjacent valley, quite pensive and out of humour. Of
these one among the rest had wedded seven husbands, and
promised to each of them that she would never marry
again, for she was unable to love any one like she had loved
the last. Now the lady was eagerly inventing all manner
of excuses, in order that she might return a proper answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
when examined on this part of her conduct. Another,
that had been common as the common air, affected to hum
a tune, and delay the arrival on pretence of having forgotten
some of her trickeries, as an eye-brow, or a comb;
but, spite of her art—for she could now neither lead nor
drive—she was impelled on till she came within sight of the
throne. There she beheld a vast throng, among whom
were not a few she had brought far on their way to the
worst place; and no sooner did they recognise her than
they began to hoot after and pursue her, till she took
refuge in a troop of city police.</p>
<p>Next appeared a number of persons driving before them
a certain physician along the banks of a river, whither he
had unfairly dispatched them considerably before their
time. They assailed his ears all the way with cries of
“<i>justice! justice!</i>” at the same time urging him forwards
towards the seat of judgment, where they at length arrived.
Meantime, I heard upon my left hand something like a
paddling in the water, as if some one were trying to swim;
and what should it all be but a judge, plunged into the
middle of a river, and vainly trying to wash his hands
of the foul matter that adhered to them. I inquired what
he was employed about, and he told me, that in his lifetime
he had often had them oiled so as to let the business slip
the better through them, and he would gladly get out the
stains before he came to hold up his hand before the bar.
What was yet more horrible, I saw coming under guard
of a legion of devils, all armed with rods, scourges, and
clubs, a whole posse of vintners and tailors, suffering no
little correction; and many pretended to be deaf, being
unwilling to leave the grave under dread of a far worse
lodging.</p>
<p>As they were proceeding, however, up started a little
dapper lawyer, and inquired whither they were going; to
which it was replied, that they were going to give an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
account of their works. On hearing this, the lawyer threw
himself down flat on his face in his hole again, exclaiming
at the same time, “If down I must without a plea, I am
at least so far on my way.” An innkeeper seemed in
a great sweat as he walked along, while a demon at his
elbow jeering at him cried,—“Well done, my brave fellow,
get rid of the water, that we may have no more of it in our
wine.” But a poor little tailor, well bolstered up, with
crooked fingers, and bandy legged, had not a word to say
for himself all the way he went, except, “Alas! alas! how
can any man be a thief that dies for want of bread!” As
he cried, his companions, however, rebuked him for
running down his own trade. Next followed a gang of
highwaymen, treading upon the heels of one another, and
in no little dread of treachery and cheating among each
other. These were brought up by a party of devils in the
turning of a hand, and were quartered along with the
tailors; for, as was observed by one of the company, your
real highwayman is but a wild sort of tailor. To be sure,
they were a little quarrelsome at the first, but in a short
time they went together down into the valley, and took up
their quarters very quietly together. A little behind them
came Folly, Bells, and Co., with their band of poets,
fiddlers, lovers, and fencers—that kind of people, in short,
that last dream of a day of reckoning. These were chiefly
distributed among the hangmen, Jews, scribes, and philosophers.
There were also a great many solicitors, greatly
wondering among themselves how they could have so much
conscience when dead, and none at all in their lifetime.
In short, the catch-word “silence” was the order of the day.</p>
<p>The throne of the Eternal being at length elevated, and
the mighty day of days at hand which spake of comfort to
the good, and of terror to the wicked; the sun and the
stars, like satraps, cast their glory round the footstool of
the Supreme Judge—the avenger of the innocent, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
Judge of the greatest monarchs and judges of the earth.
The wind was stilled; the waters were quiet in their ocean-sleep—the
earth being in suspense and anguish for fear of
her human offspring. The whole creation looked about to
yield up its trust in huge confusion and dismay. The just
and righteous were employed in prayer and thanksgiving;
the impious and wicked were vainly busy in weaving fresh
webs of sophistry and deceit, the better to mitigate their
sentence. On one side stood the guardian angels ready
to show how they had fulfilled the part entrusted to them;
and on the other frowned the evil genii, or the devils who
had eagerly contended with the former, and fomented the
worst human passions, attending now to aggravate every
matter of charge against their unfortunate victims. The
Ten Commandments held the guard of a narrow gate, so
straight indeed, that the most subdued and extenuated
body could not get through without leaving the better part
of his skin behind.</p>
<p>In one portion of this vast theatre were thronged
together Disgrace, Misfortune, Plague, Grief, and Trouble,
and all were in a general clamour against the doctors.
The plague admitted fairly that she had smitten many, but
it was the doctor at last who did their business. Black
Grief and Shame both said the same; and human calamities
of all kinds made open declaration that they never brought
any man to his grave without the help and abetting of a
doctor. It was thus the gentlemen of the faculty were
called to account for the number of fellow-men they had
killed, and which were found to exceed by far those who
had fallen by the sword. They accordingly took their
station upon the scaffold, provided with pen, ink, and
paper; and always as the dead were called, some or other
of them made answer to the name, and quoted the year
and day when such or such a patient passed from time to
eternity through his hands.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>
<p>They began the inquiry as far back as Adam, who, to say
the truth, was rather roughly handled about biting an apple.
“Alas!” cried one Judas that stood by, “if that were such
a fault, what must be the end of me, who sold and betrayed
my own Lord and Master?” Then next approached the
race of patriarchs; and next the Apostles, who took up
their places by the side of St. Peter. It was well worth
observing that on this day there was not a whit distinction
between kings and beggars: all were equal before the
judgment-seat. Herod and Pilate had no sooner put out
their heads, than they found it was likely to go hard with
them. “My judgment, however, is just,” exclaimed Pilate.
“But alas!” cried Herod, “what have I to confide in?
Heaven is no abiding place for me, and in Limbo I shall
fall among the very innocents whom I murdered; I have
no choice, therefore, but must e’en take up my quarters in
Hell—the general refuge for the most notorious malefactors.”
After this, a rough sort of sour, ill-grained fellow,
made his appearance: “See here,” he cried, “here are my
credentials—take these letters.” The company, surprised
at his odd humour, inquired of the porter who he was?
“Who am I?” quoth he, “I am master of the noble
science of defence”: then pulling out a number of sealed
parchments, “These will bear witness to my exploits.” As
he said these words, the testimonials fell out of his hand,
and two devils near him were just going to pick them up,
to keep as evidence against him at his trial, but the fencer
was too nimble for them, and seized on them. An angel,
however, now offered him his hand to help him in; while
he, as if fearing an attack, leapt a step back, throwing
himself into an attitude of defence. “Now,” he exclaimed,
“if you like, I will give you a taste of my skill”; upon
which the company set a-laughing, and this sentence was
pronounced against him:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span> “That since by his art he had
caused so many duels and murders, he should himself be
allowed to go to the devil in a perpendicular line.” He
pleaded he was no mathematician, and knew no such a
line; but with that word a devil came up, and gave him
a twirl or two round, and down he tumbled before he could
bring his sentence to an end.</p>
<p>The public treasurers came after him, pursued by such a
hooting at their heels, that some supposed the whole band
of thieves themselves were coming; which others denying,
the company fell into a dispute upon it. They were greatly
troubled at the word “thieves,” and one and all requested
they might be permitted to have the benefit of counsel.
“For a very good reason,” said one of the devils. “Here’s
a discarded apostle, a Judas, that played into both hands
at once; seize him!”</p>
<p>On hearing this, the treasurers turned away; but a vast
roll of accusations against them, held in another devil’s
hand, met their eyes, and one of them exclaimed, “For
mercy’s sake, away with those informations! We will one
and all submit to any penalty; to remain in purgatory a
thousand years, if you will only remove them from our
sight.” “Is it so?” quoth the cunning devil that had
drawn out the charges—“you are hard put to it to think
of compounding on terms like these.” The treasurers had
no more to say; but, finding they must make the best of a
bad case, they very quietly followed the dancing-master.</p>
<p>Close upon the last came an unfortunate pastryman, and
on being asked if he wished to be tried, he replied that he
did, and with the help of the Lord would stand the
venture. The counsel against him then prest the charge;
namely, that he had roasted cats for hares, and filled his
pies with bones in place of meat, and sold nothing but
horse-flesh, dogs, and foxes, in lieu of good beef and
mutton. It turned out, in fact, that Noah had never had
so many animals in his ark as this ingenious fellow had put
in his pies (for we hear of no rats and mice in the former);<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
so that, in utter despair, he threw up his cause, and went
to be baked in his turn with other sinners like himself.</p>
<p>“Next came and next did go” a company of barefoot
philosophers with their syllogisms, and it was amusing
enough to hear them chop logic, and try all manner of
questions in mood and figure, at the expense of their own
souls. Yet the most entertaining of them all were the
poets, who refused to be tried at any lesser tribunal than
that of Jupiter himself. Virgil, with his <i>Sicelides Musæ</i>,
made an eloquent defence of himself, declaring that he had
prophecied the Nativity. But up jumped a devil with a
long story about Mæcenas and Octavius, declaring that he
was no better than an idolater of the old school. Orpheus
then put in a word, asserting that, as he was the elder, he
ought to be allowed to speak for all, commanding the poet
to repeat his experiment of going into hell, and trying to
get out again, with as many of the company as he could
take along with him.</p>
<p>They were no sooner gone, than a churlish old miser
knocked at the gate, but was informed that it was guarded
by the Ten Commandments, to which he had always been
an utter stranger. Yet he contended that if he had not
kept, he had never broken, any of them, and proceeded to
justify his conduct from point to point. His quirks, however,
were not admitted—his works were made the rule of
decision—and he was marched off to receive a due reward.</p>
<p>He was succeeded by a gang of housebreakers and others
of the same stamp, some of whom were so fortunate as to
be saved just in the nick of time. The usurers and attorneys,
seeing this, thought they too had a good chance, and
put so good a face on the matter that Judas and Mahomet
began to look about them, and advanced rather confidently
to meet their trial, a movement which made the devils
themselves fall to laughing.</p>
<p>It was now the accusing demons of the usurers and attorneys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
proceeded with their accusations, which they took
not from the bills of indictment made out, but from the acts
of their lives, insisting upon the plain matter of fact, so as
to leave them without the possibility of an excuse. Addressing
the Judge—“The great crime of which these men
were guilty was their being attorneys at all;”—to which it
was ingeniously answered by the men of law—“No, not
so; we only acted as the secretaries of other men.” They
nearly all denied their own calling; and the result was that,
after much cross-questioning and pleading, two or three
only were acquitted, while to the rest their accusers cried
out, “You here! you are wanted elsewhere;” and they
then proceeded to swear against some other people, some
bribing the witnesses, making them say things which they
had never heard, and see things they had never seen, in
order to leave innocence no chance of escape. The lie was
concocted in all its labyrinths; and I saw Judas, Mahomet,
and Luther draw back, while the former prest his money-bag
closer to him. Luther observed that he did just the
same thing in his writings (<i>i.e.</i>, draw back); but the doctor
interrupted him, declaring that, compelled by those who had
betrayed him, <i>he</i> now appeared with the apothecary and the
barber to defend himself. On this a demon with the accusations
in his hand turned sharp round on him, asking, “Who
it was had sent the greater part of the dead then present, and
with the aid of his worthy <i>aide-de-camps</i>, had, in fact, occasioned
the whole proceedings of that day.” But the apothecary’s
advocate put in a plea for him, asserting that he had
dosed the poor people for nothing. “No matter,” retorted a
devil, “I have him down on my list; two of his pill-boxes
despatched more than ten thousand pikes could do in a
battle, such was the virulence of his poisonous drugs, with
which indeed he entered into a partnership with the plague,
and destroyed two entire villages.” The physician defended
himself from any participation in these exploits, and at last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
the apothecary was obliged to succumb, the physician and
the barber each taking the deaths that respectively belonged
to them.</p>
<p>A lawyer was next condemned for taking bribes from
both sides, and betraying both; and lurking behind him was
discovered a fellow who seemed very desirous of concealing
himself, and who, on being asked his name, replied that he
was a player. “And a very comic player indeed,” rejoined
a devil, “who had done better not to appear on that stage
to-day.” The poor wretch promised to retire, and was as
good as his word. A tribe of vintners next took their
station, accused of having assassinated numbers of thirsty
souls by substituting bad water for good wine. They tried
to defend themselves on the plea of compensation, having
supplied a hospital gratis with wine for the sacred ceremonies;
but this was overruled, as was that preferred by the
tailors, of having clothed some charity boys on the same
terms, and they were all sent to the same place.</p>
<p>Three or four rich merchants next appeared, who had got
wealth by defrauding their correspondents and creditors,
but the accusing demon now informed them they would
find it more difficult to make a composition; and turning
towards Jupiter, he said, “Other men, my Lord Judge, have
to give account of their own affairs, but these have had to
do with everybody’s.” Sentence was forthwith pronounced,
but I could not well catch it, so speedily they all disappeared.
A cavalier now came forward with so good a face,
and so upright, as to challenge even justice itself. He
made a very lowly obeisance on entering, but his collar was
of such a size as to defy you to say whether he had got any
head in it at all. A messenger inquired, on the part of
Jupiter, if he was a man, to which he courteously replied in
the affirmative, adding that his name was Don Fulano, on
the faith of a cavalier. At this one of the devils laughed,
and he was then asked what it was he wanted? To which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
he replied that he wanted to be saved. He was delivered
over to the demons, whom he entreated to use him gently,
lest they should chance to disorder his mustachios and ruff.
Behind him came a man uttering great lamentations, which
he himself interrupted by saying, “Though I cry, I am
none so badly off, for I have shaken the dust off the saints
themselves before now.” Every one looked round, thinking
to see a hero, or a Diocletian, from his brushing the
ears of the saints; but he turned out to be a poor wretch
whose highest office was to sweep the pictures, statues, and
other ornaments of the church. His cause seemed safe,
when all at once he was accused by one of the devils of
drinking the oil out of the lamps, but which he again laid
to the charge of an owl; that he had moreover clothed
himself out of the church suits, that he drank the wine,
ate the bread, and even laid a duty on the fees. He made
but a lame defence, and was ordered to take the left hand
road in his descent.</p>

<div class="caption">“A BEVY OF FINE LADIES, TRICKED OUT IN CAP AND FEATHER.”</div>
</div>
<p>He made way for a bevy of fine ladies, tricked out in
cap and feather, and so full of merriment that they fell to
amuse themselves with the odd figures of the demons themselves.
It was stated by their advocate that they had been
“excellent devotees.” “True,” retorted the demon, “devoted
to anything but chastity and virtue.” “Yes, certainly,” replied
one that had taken her full fling in life, and whose trial now
came on. She was accused of making religion itself a
cloak, and even marrying, the better to conceal the enormities
of her conduct. When condemned she retired,
bitterly complaining that, had she known the result, she
would have taken care not to have done any of the charitable
things, and said so many masses as she had.</p>
<p>Next, after some delay, appeared Judas, Mahomet, and
Martin Luther, of whom a messenger inquired which of
the three was Judas? To this both Mahomet and Luther
replied that he was the man; on which Judas cried out in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
rage that they were both liars, for that he was the true
Judas, and that they only affected to be so, in order to
escape a worse fate than his, for though he had indeed sold
his Master, the world had been the better of it, while the
other rascals, by selling both themselves and his Master,
had well-nigh ruined it. They were all sent to the place
they deserved.</p>
<p>An attorney who held the evidence in his hand now
called on the alguazils and runners to answer the accusations
brought against them. They cut a woful figure, and
so clear was the case against them, that they were condemned
without more ado.</p>
<p>An astrologer now entered with his astrolabes, globes,
and other quackery, crying out that there was some mistake,
for that was not the Day of Judgment, as Saturn
had not yet completed his course, nor he out of sheer fear
his own. But a devil turned round on him, and seeing
him loaded with wooden instruments and maps, exclaimed,
“Well done, friend, you have brought firewood along with
you, though it is a hard thing, methinks, after making so
many heavens as are here, you should be sent to the wrong
place at last for the want of a single one.” “I will not go,
not I,” said the astrologer. “Then carry him,” said the
devil, and away he went.</p>
<p>The whole court after this broke up: the shadows and
clouds withdrew, the air grew refreshing, flowers scented
once more the breezes, the sunny sky reappeared, while I
methought remained in the valley; and wandering about,
heard a good deal of noise and voices of lamentation, as if
rising out of the ground. I pressed forward to inquire
what it could be, and I saw in a hollow cavern (a fit mouth
to hell) a number of persons in pain. Among these was a
<i>Letrado</i>, but busied not so much with dead laws as with
live coals,—and an <i>Escrivano</i>, devouring only letters. A
miser was there, counting more pangs than pieces; a physician<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
contemplating a dead patient; and an apothecary
steeped in his own mixtures.</p>
<p>I laughed so outright at this that I started wide awake,
and was withal more merry than sad to find myself on my
bed.</p>
<p>The foregoing indeed are dreams, but such as if your
excellency will sleep upon them, it will come to pass, that
in order to see the things as I see them, you will pray for
them to turn out as I say they are.</p>

<p><i>D. Alfonsa.</i> Brother?</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> Well, sister Alfonsa?</p>
<p><i>D. Alfonsa.</i> I have something to tell you.</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> Deuce take it, everybody has something to
tell me. But it’s my own fault for listening.</p>
<p><i>D. Alfonsa.</i> Are we alone?</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> Yes, sister.</p>
<p><i>D. Alfonsa.</i> Will you be angry at what I’m going to tell
you?</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> How do I know?</p>
<p><i>D. Alfonsa.</i> Well, you know....</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> I don’t know.</p>
<p><i>D. Alfonsa.</i> ... That I am a woman....</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> I don’t know anything of the kind.</p>
<p><i>D. Alfonsa.</i> Brother?...</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> Do be quick and have done with it. You’ll
all be the death of me.</p>
<p><i>D. Alfonsa.</i> Well, I am a woman, and in love....</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> The point at last.</p>
<p><i>D. Alfonsa.</i> And with Don Pedro.</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> All right.</p>
<p><i>D. Alfonsa.</i> But he doesn’t love me; the treacherous
wretch is courting Doña Isabel, and betraying both of us.</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> I say, I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><i>D. Alfonsa.</i> Well, you know, I often have fainting fits.</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> Yes!</p>
<p><i>D. Alfonsa.</i> And do you remember that I also had one
at the inn at Illescas?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> Well, what of that?</p>
<p><i>D. Alfonsa.</i> You must know it was feigned.</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> And now who’ll believe you when you really
have one?</p>
<p><i>D. Alfonsa.</i> I did it with a motive. Don Pedro, the
traitor, thinking it was real, seized the opportunity to say a
thousand tender things to Doña Isabel. I would have
given vent to my rage, but he is so far gone, he even makes
love to her before <i>you</i>.</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> A pretty how-d’ye-do!</p>
<p><i>D. Alfonsa.</i> Last—night—he—met—her—in—the—parlour—secretly....
And now you know my wrongs. Make
haste and avenge both yourself and me on that treacherous
Don Pedro.</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> A pretty kettle of fish. But, devil take it,
Don Luis has just been to tell me that Isabel is in love with
<i>him</i>. Perhaps she loves them both, she seems to have a
great facility that way. But if Don Pedro is her accepted
lover, I’ll pay them both out! I shall have such a revenge
as shall last their whole lives! To kill them would be too
poor a vengeance.</p>

  <i>Don Luis.</i> <br>
</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> Listen, all of you. Señor Don Luis, whom
you here behold, has told me he is Doña Isabel’s lover,
and that he must marry her, for she gave him her word
at Illescas and....</p>
<p><i>Periwig.</i> Oh no, beg pardon, sir. I saw the gent knock
at a door at Illescas and palaver with Doña Alfonsa, whom
he took for the young lady. Don’t you remember, sir, you
heard a noise, and came out with a light and your sword?
Well, it was him, sir.</p>
<p><i>Don Luis.</i> I will not deny it. You came forth, and I
discreetly hid, but I thought I was speaking with Isabel,
not with Alfonsa.</p>
<p><i>D. Alfonsa.</i> Wait, it was I with whom you spoke, but I
took you for Don Pedro.</p>
<p><i>Don Pedro.</i> (<i>aside</i>). Blessings upon Cupid and my lucky
star.</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> Well, that’s one gallant done with. But to
proceed (<i>to Don Pedro</i>), my sister, Doña Alfonsa, tells me
treacherous and unloyal fellow, that you love Isabel.</p>
<p><i>Don Pedro.</i> Yes, it is so. I confess I have long loved
her, before you even thought of her; and who can blame
my impotence to stifle a love so great that....</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> Hold your tongue, young cousin, for by
h——, but no, I won’t swear.... I must have fierce and
fatal vengeance.</p>
<p><i>Don Pedro.</i> Plunge your poniard into this my throat.</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> No, I won’t do that; I don’t want to kill
you: that’s what you’d like.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>
<p><i>Don Pedro.</i> Then what will you do?</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> You shall know. You, Don Pedro, are a
pauper, and but for me would have starved.</p>
<p><i>Don Pedro.</i> It is true.</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> Doña Isabel is a beggar. I was going to
marry her for her looks only, for she hasn’t a farthing for a
dowry.</p>
<p><i>Don Pedro.</i> But she is virtuous and beautiful.</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> Well, then, give her your hand, for this is my
vengeance. You are very poor, and she is very poor; no
more happiness for you. Love flies out of the window
when poverty enters the door. On your wedding-day you
may laugh at me, but on the morrow when breakfasting on
kisses, with vows on the table for victuals, and constancy
for supper, Love instead of a silk frock, and “Darling” to
keep you warm, you will see who laughs longest and last.</p>
<p><i>Don Pedro.</i> Cousin....</p>
<p><i>Don Lucas.</i> I say, you shall marry her.</p>
<p><i>Periwig.</i> (<i>aside</i>). The punishment is <i>too</i> severe!</p>

shall soon be at Zalamea.</p>
<p><i>Reb.</i> And where will be the good of that if I’m  dead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
before I get there? And if not, ’twill only be from bad to
worse: for if we all reach the place alive, as sure as death
up comes Mr. Mayor to persuade the Commissary we had
better march on to the next town. At first Mr. Commissary
replies very virtuously, “Impossible! the men are
fagged to death.” But after a little pocket persuasion, then
it’s all “Gentlemen, I’m very sorry, but orders have come
for us to march forward, and immediately,” and away we
have to trot, foot-weary, dust bedraggled, and starved as we
are. Well, I swear if I do get alive to Zalamea to-day, I’ll
not leave it this side o’ sunrise for love, lash, or money.
It won’t be the first time in my life I’ve given ‘em the
slip.</p>
<p><i>1st. Sold.</i> Nor the first time a poor fellow has had the
slip given him for doing so. And more likely than ever
now that Don Lope de Figuerroa has taken the command,
a fine brave fellow they say, but a devil of a tartar, who’ll
have every inch of duty done, or take the change out of his
own son, without waiting for trial either.<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_8" id="FNanchor_8">[8]</a></p>
<p><i>Reb.</i> Listen to this now, gentlemen! By Heaven, I’ll be
beforehand with him.</p>
<p><i>2nd. Sold.</i> Come, come, a soldier shouldn‘t talk so.</p>
<p><i>Reb.</i> I tell you it isn’t for myself I care so much, as for
this poor little thing that follows me.</p>
<p><i>Chis.</i> Signor Rebolledo, don’t you fret about me; you
know I was born with a beard on my heart if not on my
chin, if ever girl was; and your fearing for me is as bad as
if I was afeard myself. Why, when I came along with you
I made up my mind to hardship and danger for honour’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
sake; else if I’d wanted to live in clover, I never should
have left the Alderman who kept such a table as all aldermen
don’t, I promise you. Well, what’s the odds? I chose
to leave him and follow the drum, and here I am, and if I
don’t flinch, why should you?</p>
<p><i>Reb.</i> ‘Fore Heaven, you’re the crown of womankind!</p>
<p><i>Soldiers.</i> So she is, so she is, <i>Viva la Chispa!</i></p>
<p><i>Reb.</i> And so she is, and one cheer more for her—hurrah!
especially if she’ll give us a song to lighten the way.</p>
<p><i>Chis.</i> The castanet shall answer for me.</p>

<p><i>Nuñ.</i> But worse for those who hav.</p>
<p><i>Men.</i> What do you mean, sir?</p>
<p><i>Nuñ.</i> I mean the squires. Ah, sir; if the soldiers are
billeted on them, do you know why?</p>
<p><i>Men.</i> Well, why?</p>
<p><i>Nuñ.</i> For fear of being starved—which would be a bad
job for the kin service.</p>
<p><i>Men.</i> God rest my father’s soul, says I, who left me a
pedigree and patent all blazon’d in gold and azure, that
exempts me from such impositions.</p>
<p><i>Nuñ.</i> I wish h left you the gold in a more available
shape, however.</p>
<p><i>Men.</i> Though, indeed, when I come to think of it, I
do know if I owe him any thanks; considering that,
unless he had consented to beget me an Hidalgo at once,
I would have been born at all, for him or any one.</p>
<p><i>Nuñ.</i> Humph! Could you have hel it?</p>
<p><i>Men.</i> Easily.</p>
<p><i>Nuñ.</i> How, sir.</p>
<p><i>Men.</i> You must know that every one that is born is the

<p><i>Nuñ.</i> I only know it is now three lock, and we have
neither of us yet had anything but our own spittle to chew.</p>
<p><i>Men.</i> Perhaps so, but there are distinctions of rank. An
Hidalgo, sir, has no belly.</p>
<p><i>Nuñ.</i> Oh, Lord! that I were an Hidalgo!</p>

things. But let me hear no more of the matter; we are

why on earth, sir, do you ask her in marriage of
her father; by doing which you would kill two birds with
one stone: get yourself something to eat, and his grandchildren
squires.</p>
<p><i>Men.</i> Hold your tongue, sir, it is impious. Am I, an
Hidalgo with such a pedigree, to demean myself with a
plebeian connection just for money’s sake?</p>
<p><i>Nuñ.</i> Well, I’ve always heard say a mean father-in-law
is best; better stumble on a pebble than run your head
again a post. But, however, if you do mean marriage,
sir, what do you mean?</p>
<p><i>Men.</i> And pray, sir, what business is that of yours? But
go directly, and tell me if you can get a sight of her?</p>

I bid you.</p>

<p><i>Serg.</i> Yes, to tell him of the arrival of Don Alvaro de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
Ataide, captain of the troop that has just marched into
Zalamea, and quartered upon him.</p>
<p><i>Cres.</i> Say no more; my house and all I have is ever at
the service of the king, and of all who have authority under
him. If you will leave his things here, I will see his room
is got ready directly; and do you tell his Honour that,
come when he will, he shall find me and mine at his service.</p>
<p><i>Serg.</i> Good—he will be here directly.</p>

<p><i>Juan.</i> I wonder, father, that, rich as you are, you still
submit yourself to these nuisances.</p>
<p><i>Cres.</i> Why, boy, how could I help them?</p>
<p><i>Juan.</i> You know; by buying a patent of Gentility.</p>
<p><i>Cres.</i> A patent of Gentility! upon thy life now dost
think ther a soul who does know that  no gentleman
at all, but just a plain farmer? Wha the use of my
buying a patent of Gentility, if I ca buy the gentle blood
along with it? will any one think me a bit more of a gentleman
for buying fifty patents? Not a whit; I should only
prove I was worth so many thousand royals, not that I had
gentle blood in my veins, which ca be bought at any
price. If a fello been bald ever so long, and buys him
a fine wig and claps it on, will his neighbours think it is
his own hair a bit the more? No, they will say, “So-and-so
has a fine wig; and, wha more, he must have paid
handsomely for it too.” But they know his bald pate is
safe under it all the while. Tha all he gets by it.</p>
<p><i>Juan.</i> Nay, sir, he gets to look younger and handsomer,
and keeps off sun and cold.</p>
<p><i>Cres.</i> Tut! I’ll have none of your wig honour at any

quartered upon this house; and one of my soldiers——</p>
<p><i>Lope.</i> Well, sir, go on.</p>
<p><i>Capt.</i> Insulted me so grossly I was obliged to draw my
sword on him. He ran up here, where it seems these two
girls live; and I, not knowing there was any harm, after
him; at which these men, their father or brother, or
some such thing, take affront. This is the whole business.</p>
<p><i>Lope.</i> I am just come in time then to settle it. First,

<p><i>Reb.</i> What, am I to pay the piper?</p>

<p><i>Reb.</i> Oh, I dare say, after being marched off with my
hands behind me like a coward. Noble commander, ’twas
the captain’s own doing; he made me pretend a quarrel,
that he might get up here to see the women.</p>
<p><i>Cres.</i> I <i>had</i> some cause for quarrel, you see.</p>
<p><i>Lope.</i> Not enough to peril the peace of the town for.
Halloa there! beat all to quarters on pain of death. And,
to prevent further ill blood here, do you (<i>to the</i> <span class="smcap">Captain</span>)

<p><i>Lope.</i> What, sir, a captain in his Majest service?</p>
<p><i>Cres.</i> Aye, a general, if he insulted me.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>
<p><i>Lope.</i> I tell you, whoever lays his little finger on the
humblest private in the regiment, I’ll hang him.</p>
<p><i>Cres.</i> And I tell you, whoever points his little finger at
my honour, I’ll  cut him down before hanging.</p>
<p><i>Lope.</i> Know you not, you are bound by your allegiance
to submit.</p>
<p><i>Cres.</i> To all cost of property, yes; but of honour, no,
no, no! My goods and chattels, aye, and my life—are the
kin; but my honour is my own sou, and that is—God
Almight.</p>
<p><i>Lope.</i> ‘Fore God, ther some truth in what you say.</p>
<p><i>Cres.</i> ‘Fore God, there ought to be, for I’ve been some
years saying it.</p>
<p><i>Lope.</i> Well, well. I’ve come a long way, and this leg of
mine, which I wish the devil who gave it would carry
[<i>sic</i>] away with him! cries for rest.</p>
<p><i>Cres.</i> And who prevents its taking some? the same devil
I suppose who gave you your leg, gave me a bed, which I
do want him to take away again, however, on which your
leg may lie if it like.</p>
<p><i>Lope.</i> But did the devil, when he was about it, make
your bed as well as give it?</p>
<p><i>Cres.</i> To be sure he did.</p>
<p><i>Lope.</i> Then I’ll unmake it—Heaven knows  weary

<p class="drop-cap">“L<span class="smcap">ook</span>,” said Juanillo, “we have now arrived at the
Puerta del Sol, one of the chief resorts in Madrid.
This site of beautiful things, rightly called the Sol or Sun,
is renowned not only in Madrid, but throughout the whole
world.” Just then the cries and loud sobs of a lad made
them turn to inquire the cause, and Onofre, asking a boy
close by, was told it was a doctor’s groom who had gone
out to sell a mule too slow for his master, who, on account
of his large practice, required one with more go.</p>
<p>“Are there so many sick in Madrid?” asked Onofre; to
which the boy replied: “He lives in a suburb of delicate
people, who dress richly, lie a long time in bed, have all
their windows shut to keep out the air, and if their chocolate
is too sweet or too highly spiced, say it has done them
harm, and then they send for the doctor, who, to feel the
pulses and purses of all, needs a lively mule, and so he
wanted to sell his slow one.”</p>
<p>The boy went on to relate how the groom soon found
a buyer in the servant of a country doctor, just arrived
on horseback between the panniers of bread, a trick
worthy of the devil himself, since that they might not
suspect Death was entering the gates of Madrid, he came
cloaked with the chief support of life; for they say he
was abandoning his last residence, since it had lost half
its population during the one year of his stay, and was,
therefore, coming to Madrid, where, on account of its
size, he hoped his work would not be so noticeable. With
this executione servant ... a bargain was struck, and
the buyer allowed to try the mule, after entertaining and
bribing the groom; whereupon he vanished down the street
of Alcalá.</p>
<p>Onofre smiled at the youth’s humour, and approaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
the blubbering groom, heard the crowd trying to advise
and console him in various ways: to look in all the hostries,
where the thief might have taken the mule to give it a feed;
that his master would easily earn his value in four days;
that it was no good crying over spilt milk, to all of which
the groom wept loudly, the big tears running down his
cheeks, which, as well as his nose, he wiped with his cape
and shirt-sleeves. Onofre felt sorry for the poor fellow,
but Juanillo, calling him, told him such things often happened
market days, and he knew another case, which
showed the astuteness of some thieves.</p>
<p>A groom went, like this one, to sell a mule, which was,
however, so young and wild, his master could not ride it.
He arrived at the market and straightway found a buyer,
for those simple fellows always come across crafty rogues,
up to all kinds of tricks. They quickly came to terms, and
the thief asked the lad to come for his money astride his
mule to a surgeon-barber, for whom it was purchased. He
then lead him to a shop where he had been shaved once or
twice, and, leaving him outside on the mule, inquired for
the master, and after the customary salutations, told him he
had brought a sick groom whom he wished to be examined,
and cured if possible, but that, as he was very shy and
embarrassed, and had put off coming to a doctor for a long
time, he must try not to frighten him, and ask the lad to
wait a while inside till he could see him, lest he should run
away. He then paid half the fee and said he would pay
the rest afterwards. The barber, highly pleased, went out
and asked the groom to come in and wait, and his business
would soon be despatched.</p>
<p>“You know my business?” said the lad.</p>
<p>“Certainly,” said the barber.</p>
<p>The cheat, telling the groom that the barber would give
him a dozen reals for himself beside the price for the mule,
mounted, clapped spurs to the mule, and made off.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>
<p>The groom, after waiting some little time, found out the
fraud as soon as the barber began questioning him as to his
health, and set up a great hullabaloo, whereupon the police
hastened by, but could only warn him to be more prudent
next time, with the hope that God would console him
meanwhile.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A<span class="smcap"> town</span> in Spain on the banks of the Tagus, just
about to celebrate Corpus Christi, sent to a neighbouring
town for the giants and the huge serpent, called La
Tarasca. On the eve of the festival the bearers, in order to
arrive in good time to join the procession, set out at dusk,
with the intention of reaching their destination at break of
day. They were inside the huge effigies, which were
borne on their shoulders exactly as when they dance
through the streets. The moon rose during their journey
and shone down on the strange figures, to the great amazement
and alarm of some carriers with loads of wine, who,
becoming aware of the serpent and the giants behind, only
screwed together enough courage to take to their heels as
fast as they could. The bearers cried after them to come
back and look after their teams, but in vain, the more they
shouted, the faster they fled. Thereupon the porters of La
Tarasca set her down and repaired to the mules, and when
they perceived the sweet spoils they had won without any
bloodshed, called to the bearers of the giants, and they all
drank to each other’s health in such long draughts and
hearty quaffs, that the liquor rose to their heads and laid
them full length on the road.</p>
<p>The carriers, who were great braggarts, returned home
and told their Alcalde how they had encountered such
giant thieves; and the whole township, armed with cross-bows,
lances and cudgels, sallied out in quest of these odd
fish. They arrived at the spot, making so great a din, they
almost awakened their foes, whom they found stretched
on the ground.</p>

<p>The Alcalde, much amused at the jest, gave judgment
that the carriers were to pay with wine those who had come
to their help; upon which all drank to their hear content
till the citizens and soldiers returned homewards and the
porters again shouldered their burdens.</p>

three-and-thirty years old, tall, robust, and stout;
his limbs well set and well proportioned; manly in gait,
inclining to corpulence, with an erect carriage of his head,
and the circle of hair round his tonsure studiously and
exactly combed and shaven. His clerical dress was always
neat, and fell round his person in ample and regular folds.
His shoes fitted him with the greatest nicety, and, above all,
his silken cap was adorned with much curious embroidery
and a fanciful tassel—the work of certain female devotees
who were dying with admiration of their favourite preacher.
In short, he had a very youthful, gallant look; and, adding
to this a clear, rich voice, a slight fashionable lisp, a peculiar
grace in telling a story, a talent at mimicry, an easy action,
a taking manner, a high-sounding style, and not a little
effrontery—never forgetting to sprinkle jests, proverbs, and
homely phrases along his discourses with a most agreeable
aptness—he won golden opinions in his public discourses,
and carried everything before him in the drawing-rooms he
frequented.</p>

<p>It was well known that he always began his sermons with
some proverb, some jest, some pothouse witticism, or some
strange fragment, which, taken from its proper connections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
and relations, would seem, at first blush, to be an inconsequence,
a blasphemy, or an impiety; until at last, having
kept his audience waiting a moment in wonder, he finished
the clause, or came out with an explanation which reduced
the whole to a sort of miserable trifling. Thus, preaching
one day on the mystery of the Trinity, he began his sermon
by saying, “I deny that God exists a Unity in essence and
a Trinity in person,” and then stopped short for an instant.
The hearers, of course, looked round on one another scandalised,
or, at least, wondering what would be the end of
this heretical blasphemy. At length, when the preacher
thought he had fairly caught them, he went on, “Thus says
the Ebionite, the Marcionite, the Arian, the Manichean,
the Socinian; but I prove it against them all from the
Scriptures, the Councils, and the Fathers.”</p>
<p>In another sermon, which was on the Incarnation, he
began by crying out, “Your health, cavaliers!” and, as the
audience burst into a broad laugh at the free manner in
which he had said it, he went on, “This is no joking matter,
however; for it was for your health and for mine, and for
that of all men, that Christ descended from heaven and
became incarnate in the Virgin Mary. It is an article of
faith, and I prove it thus: ‘<i>Propter nos, homines et nostram
salutem decendit de cœlo et incarnatus est</i>,’”—whereat they
all remained in delighted astonishment, and such a murmur
of applause ran round the church that it wanted little of
breaking out into open acclamation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MARIQUITA_THE_BALD"> <i>MARIQUITA THE BALD.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class="center">(A TALE AFTER THE STYLE OF AN OLD CHRONICLE.)</p>
<p class="drop-cap">I<span class="smcap">t</span> is as sorry a matter to use the words of which one
ignores the meaning as it is a blemish for a man of
sense to speak of what he knows nothing about. I say
this to those of you who may have the present story in your
hands, however often you may have happened to have
heard <i>Mariquita the Bald</i> mentioned, and I swear by my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
doublet that you shall soon know who Mariquita the Bald
was, as well as I know who ate the Christmas turkey,
setting aside the surmise that it certainly must have been a
mouth.</p>
<p>I desire, therefore, to enlighten your ignorance of this
subject, and beg to inform you that the said noted Maria
(Mariquita is a diminutive of Maria) was born in the
District of Segovia, and in the town of Sant Garcia, the
which town is famed for the beauty of the maidens reared
within its walls, who for the most part have such gentle and
lovely faces, that may I behold such around me at the hour
of my death. Mari father was an honest farmer, by
name Juan Lanas, a Christian old man, and much beloved,
and who had inherited no mean estate from his forefathers,
though with but little wit in his crown, a lack which was the
cause of much calamity to both the father and the daughter,
for in the times to which we have attained, God forgive me
if it is not necessary to have more of the knave than of the
fool in on composition. Now it came to pass that Juan
Lanas, for the castigation of his sins, must needs commit himself
to a lawsuit with one of his neighbours about a vine stock
which was worth about fifty maravedis; and Juan was in the
right, and the judges gave the verdict in his favour, so that
he won his case, excepting that the suit lasted no less than
ten years and the costs amounted to nothing less than fifty
thousand maravedies, not to speak of a disease of the eyes
which after all was over left him blind. When he found
himself with diminished property and without his eyesight,
in sorrow and disgust he turned into money such part of his
patrimony as sufficed to rid him of the hungry herd of
scribeners and lawyers, and took his way to Toledo with his
daughter, who was already entering upon her sixteenth
year, and had matured into one of the most beautiful,
graceful, and lovable damsels to be found throughout all
Castile and the kingdoms beyond. For she was white as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
the lily and red like the rose, straight and tall of stature,
and slender in the waist, with fair, shapely hips; and again
her foot and hand were plump and small to a marvel, and
she possessed a head of hair which reached to her knees.
For I knew the widow Sarmiento who was their housekeeper,
and she told me how she could scarcely clasp
Mariquita’s hair with both hands, and that she could not
comb the hair unless Maria stood up and the housekeeper
mounted on a footstool, for if Maria sat down, the long
tresses swept the ground, and therefore became all entangled.</p>
<p>And do not imagine her beauty and grace being such
that she sinned greatly in pride and levity, as is the wont of
girls in this age. She was as humble as a cloistered lay-sister,
and as silent as if she were not a woman, and patient
as the sucking lamb, and industrious as the ant, clean as the
ermine, and pure as a saint of those times in which, by the
grace of the Most High, saintly women were born into the
world. But I must confide to you in friendship that our
Mariquita was not a little vain about her hair, and loved to
display it, and for this reason, now in the streets, now when
on a visit, now when at mass, it is said she used to subtilely
loosen her mantilla so that her tresses streamed down her
back, the while feigning forgetfulness and carelessness. She
never wore a hood, for she said it annoyed her and choked
her; and every time that her father reproached her for
some deed deserving of punishment and threatened to cut
off her hair, I warrant you she suffered three times more
than after a lash from the whip, and would then be good
for three weeks successively; so much so that Juan Lanas,
perceiving her amendment, would laugh under his cloak,
and when saying his say to his gossips would tell them that
his daughter, like the other saint of Sicily, would reach
heaven by her hair. Having read so far, you must now
know that Juan Lanas, the blind man, with the change of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
district and dwelling did not change his judgment, and if he
was crack-brained at Sant Garcia, he remained crack-brained
at Toledo, consuming in this resort his monies upon worthless
drugs and quacks which did not cure his blindness and
impoverished him more and more every day, so that if his
daughter had not been so dexterous with her fingers in
making and broidering garments of linen, wool, and silk, I
promise you that this miserable Juan would have to have
gone for more than four Sundays without a clean shirt to
put on or a mouthful to eat, unless he had begged for it from
door to door. The years passed by to find Maria every day
more beautiful, and her father every day more blind and
more desirous to see, until his affliction and trouble took
such forcible possession of his breast and mind, that Maria
saw as clear as daylight that if her father did not recover
his sight, he would die of grief. Maria thereupon straightway
took her father and led him to the house of an Arabian
physician of great learning who dwelt at Toledo, and told
the Moor to see if there were any cure for the old ma
sight. The Arabian examined and touched Juan, and
made this and that experiment with him, and everything
was concerted in that the physician swore great oaths by the
heel-bone of Mohammed that there was a complete certainty
of curing Juan and making him to see his daughter again,
if only he, the physician, were paid for the cure with five
hundred maravedies all in gold. A sad termination for such
a welcome beginning, for the two unhappy creatures, Juan
and Maria, had neither maravedi nor cuarto in their money
box! So they went thence all downcast, and Maria never
ceased praying to his Holiness Saint John and his Holiness
Saint James (the patron saint of Spain) to repair to their
assistance in this sad predicament.</p>
<p>“In what way,” conjectured she inwardly—“in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span> what way
can I raise fifty maravedies to be quits with the worthy
Moor who will give back his sight to my poor old father?
Ah! I have it. I am a pretty maid, and suitors innumerable,
commoners and nobles, pay their addresses and
compliments to me. But all are trifling youths who only care
for love-making and who seek light o’ loves rather than
spouses according to the law of the Lord Jesus Christ. I
remember, notwithstanding, that opposite our house lives
the sword-cutler, Master Palomo, who is always looking at
me and never speaks to me, and the Virgin assist me, he
appears a man of very good condition for a husband; but
what maiden, unless she were cross-eyed or hunch-backed,
could like a man with such a flat nose, with that skin the
colour of a ripe date, with those eyes like a dead cal, and
with those huge hands, which are more like the paws of a
wild beast than the belongings of a person who with them
should softly caress the woman whom Destiny bestows upon
him for a companion? ’Tis said that he is no drunkard,
nor cudgeller, nor dallier with woman, nor a liar, and that
he is besides possessed of much property and very rich.
Pity ’tis that one who is so ugly and stiff-necked should
unite such parts.”</p>
<p>Thus turning the matter over and over in her mind, Maria
together with Juan reached their home, where was awaiting
them an esquire in a long mourning robe, who told Maria
that the aunt of the Mayor of the city had died in an honest
estate and in the flower of her age, for she had not yet completed
her seventy years, and that the obsequies of this
sexagenarian damsel were to be performed the following
day, on which occasion her coffin would be carried to the
church by maidens, and he was come to ask Maria if she
would please to be one of the bearers of the dead woman,
for which she would receive a white robe, and to eat, and a
ducat, and thanks into the bargain.</p>
<p>Maria, since she was a well brought up maid, replied
that if it seemed well to her father, it would also seem
well to her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>
<p>Juan accepted, and Maria was rejoiced to be able to make
a display of her hair, for it is well known that the maidens
who bear another to the grave walk with dishevelled locks.
And when on the morrow the tiring-women of the Mayoress
arrayed Maria in a robe white as the driven snow and fine
as the skin of an onion; and when they girt her slender
waist with a sash of crimson silk, the ends of which hung
down to the broad hem of the skirt; and when they
crowned her smooth and white forehead with a wreath of
white flowers, I warrant you that, what with the robe and the
sash and the wreath, and the beautiful streaming hair and
her lovely countenance and gracious mien, she seemed no
female formed of flesh and blood, but a superhuman
creature or blessed resident of those shining circles in which
dwell the celestial hierarchies. The Mayor and the other
mourners stepped forth to see her, and all unceasingly
praised God, who was pleased to perform such miracles for
the consolation and solace of those living in this world.
And there in a corner of the hall, motionless like a heap of
broken stones, stood one of the mutes with the hood of his
long cloak covering his head, so that nothing could be seen
but his eyes, the which he kept fixed on the fair damsel.
The latter modestly lowered her eyes to the ground with
her head a little bent and her cheeks red for bashfulness,
although it pleased her no little to hear the praises of her
beauty. At this moment a screen was pushed aside, and
there began to appear a huge bulk of petticoats, which was
nothing less than the person of the Mayoress, for she was
with child and drawing near to her time. And when she
saw Maria, she started, opened her eyes a hand’s-breadth
wide, bit her lips, and called hurriedly for her husband.
They stepped aside for a good while, and then hied them
thence, and when they returned the mutes and maidens had
all gone.</p>
<p>While they are burying the defunct lady I must tell you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
curious readers, that the Mayor and Mayoress had been
married for many years without having any children, and
they longed for them like the countryman for rain in the
month of May, and at last her hour of bliss came to the
Mayoress, to the great content of her husband. Now, it
was whispered that the said lady had always been somewhat
capricious; judge for yourselves what she would be now in
the time of her pregnancy! And as she was already on
the way to fifty, she was more than mediocrely bald and
hairless, and on these very same days had commissioned a
woman barber, who lived in the odour of witchcraft, to
prepare for her some false hair, but it was not to be that of
a dead woman, for the Mayoress said very sensibly that if
the hair belonged to a dead woman who rejoiced in supreme
glory, or was suffering for her sins in purgatory, it would be
profanation to wear any pledge of theirs, and if they were
in hell, it was a terrible thing to wear on on person relics
of one of the damned. And when the Mayoress saw the
abundant locks of Maria, she coveted them for herself, and
it was for this reason that she called to the Mayor to speak
to her in private and besought him eagerly to persuade
Maria to allow herself to be shorn upon the return from the
burial.</p>
<p>“I warn you,” said the Mayor, “that you are desirous of
entering upon a very knotty bargain, for the dishevelled girl
idolises her hair in such wise, that she would sooner lose
a finger than suffer one of her tresses to be cut off.”</p>
<p>“I warn you,” replied the Mayoress, “that if on this
very day the head of this young girl is not shorn smooth
beneath my hand as a melon, the child to which I am about
to give birth will have a head of hair on its face, and if it
happens to be a female, look you, a pretty daughter is in
store for you!”</p>
<p>“But bethink yourself that Maria will ask, who knows, a
good few crowns for this shaving.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>
<p>“Bethink yourself, that if not, your heir or heiress, begotten
after so many years’ marriage, will come amiss; and
bear in mind, by the way, that we are not so young as to
hope to replace this by another.”</p>
<p>Upon this she turned her back to the Mayor, and went
to her apartment crying out: “I want the hair, I must have
the hair, and if I do not get the hair, by my halidom I shall
never become a mother.”</p>
<p>In the meantime the funeral had taken place without any
novelty to mention, excepting that if in the streets any loose
fellow in the crowd assayed to annoy the fair Maria, the
hooded mute, of whom we made mention before, quickly
drew from beneath his cloak a strap, with which he gave a
lash to the insolent rogue without addressing one word to
him, and then walked straight on as if nothing had happened.
When all the mourners returned, the Mayor seized hold of
Mari hand and said to her—</p>
<p>“And now, fair maid, let us withdraw for a little while into
this other apartment,” and thus talking whilst in motion he
brought her into his wife’s private tiring-room, and sat himself
down in a chair and bent his head and stroked his beard with
the mien of one who is studying what beginning to give to
his speech. Maria, a little foolish and confused, remained
standing in front of the Mayor, and she also humbly
lowered before him her eyes, black as the sloe; and to
occupy herself with something, gently fingered the ends of
the sash which girded her waist and hung down over her
skirt, not knowing what to expect from the grave mien and
long silence of the Mayor, who, raising his eyes and looking
up at Maria, when he beheld her in so modest a posture,
devised thence a motive with which to begin, saying—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>
<p>“Forsooth, Maria, so modest and sanctimonious is thy
bearing, that it is easy to see thou art preparing thyself to
become a black wimpled nun. And if it be so, as I
presume it to be, I now offer of my own accord to dispose
of thy entry into the cloisters without any dowry, on condition
that thou dost give me something that thou hast
on thy head, and which then wilt not be necessary for
thee.”</p>
<p>“Nay, beshrew me, Sir Mayor,” replied Maria, “for I
durst not think that the Lord calls upon me to take that
step, for then my poor father would remain in the world
without the staff of his old age.”</p>
<p>“Then, now, I desire to give thee some wise counsel,
maid Maria. Thou dost gain thy bread with great fatigue,
thou shouldst make use of thy time as much as is possible.
Now one of thy neighbours hath told me, that in the dressing
of thy hair, thou doth waste every day more than
an hour. It would be better far if thou didst spend this
hour on thy work rather than in the dressing and braiding
which thou dost to thy hair.”</p>
<p>“That is true, Sir Mayor,” replied Maria, turning as red
as a carnation, “but, look you, it is not my fault if I have a
wealth of tresses, the combing and plaiting of which necessitates
so long a time every morning.”</p>
<p>“I tell thee it is thy fault,” retorted the Mayor, “for if
thou didst cut off this mane, thou would save thyself all
this combing and plaiting, and thus would have more time
for work, and so gain more money, and would also give no
occasion to people to call thee vain. They even say that
the Devil will some day carry thee off by thy hair. Nay,
do not be distressed, for I already perceive the tears gathering
in thy eyes, for thou hast them indeed very ready at
hand; I admonish thee for thine own good without any self-interest.
Cut thy hair off, shear thyself, shave thyself, good
Maria, and to allay the bitterness of the shearing, I will give
fifty maravedies, always on condition that thou dost hand
me over the hair.”</p>
<p>When Maria at first heard this offer of so reasonable
a sum for this her hair, it seemed to her a jest of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
Mayo, and she smiled right sweetly while she dried her
tears, repeating—</p>
<p>“You will give me fifty maravedies if I shave myself?”</p>
<p>Now it appeared to the Mayor (who, it is said, was not
gifted with all the prudence of Ulysses) that that smile
signified that the maid was not satisfied with so small a
price, and he added—</p>
<p>“If thou wilt not be content with fifty maravedies, I will
give thee a hundred.”</p>
<p>Then Maria saw some hangings of the apartment moving
in front of her, and perceiving a bulky protuberance, she
immediately divined that the Mayoress was hiding behind
there, and that the protuberance was caused by her portly
form. She now discovered the Mayo design, and that it
was probably a caprice of his spouse, and she made a vow
not to suffer herself to be shorn unless she acquired by
these means the five hundred maravedies needful to pay the
Arabian physician who would give her father back his eyesight.</p>
<p>Then the Mayor raised his price from a hundred maravedies
to a hundred and fifty, and afterwards to two hundred,
and Maria continued her sweet smiling, shaking of the head
and gestures, and every time that the Mayor bid higher and
Maria feigned to be reluctant, she almost hoped that the
Mayor would withdraw from his proposition, for the great
grief it caused her to despoil herself of that precious ornament,
notwithstanding that by means of it she might gain
her father’s health. Finally the Mayor, anxious to conclude
the treaty, for he saw the stirring of the curtains, and knew
by them the anxiety and state of mind of the listener,
closed by saying—</p>
<p>“Go to, hussy, I will give thee five hundred maravedies,
see, once and for all, if thou canst agree to these
terms.”</p>
<p>“Be it so,” replied Maria, sighing as if her soul would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
flee from her flesh with these words—“be it so, so long that
nobody doth know that I remain bald.”</p>
<p>“I will give my word for it,” said the Mayoress, stepping
from behind the curtains with a pair of sharp shears in her
hands and a wrapper over her arm.</p>
<p>When Maria saw the scissors she turned as yellow as wax,
and when they told her to sit down on the sacrificial chair,
she felt herself grow faint and had to ask for a drink of
water; and when they tied the wrapper round her throat it
is related that she would have immediately torn it asunder
if her courage had not failed her. And when at the first
movement of the shears she felt the cold iron against her
skull, I tell you it seemed to her as if they were piercing
her heart with a bright dagger. It is possible that she did
not keep her head still for a moment while this tonsuring
was taking place; she moved it in spite of herself, now to
one side, now to another, to flee from the clipping scissors,
of which the rude cuts and the creaking axis wounded her
ears. Her posture and movements, however, were of no
avail to the poor shorn maiden, and the pertinacious shearer,
with the anxiety and covetousness of a pregnant woman
satisfying a caprice, seized the hair well, or ill, by handfuls,
and went on bravely clipping, and the locks fell on to the
white wrapper, slipping down thence till they reached the
ground.</p>
<p>At last the business came to an end, and the Mayoress,
who was beside herself with joy, caressingly passed the
palm of her hand again and again over the mai bald
head from the front to the back, saying—</p>
<p>“By my mother’s soul, I have shorn you so regularly and
close to root, that the most skilful barber could not have
shorn you better. Get up and braid the hair while my
husband goes to get the money and I your clothes, so that
you can leave the house without any one perceiving it.”</p>

<div class="caption">“AT THE FIRST MOVEMENT OF THE SHEARS ... IT SEEMED TO HER AS IF
THEY WERE PIERCING HER HEART WITH A BRIGHT DAGGER.”</div>
</div>
<p>The Mayor and Mayoress went out of the room, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
Maria, as soon as she found herself alone, went to look at
herself in a mirror that hung there; and when she saw herself
bald she lost the patience she had had until then, and
groaned with rage and struck herself, and even tried to
wrench off her ears, which appeared to her now outrageously
large, although they were not so in reality. She stamped
upon her hair and cursed herself for having ever consented to
lose it, without remembering her father, and just as if she
had no father at all. But as it is a quality of human nature
to accept what cannot be altered, poor angry Maria calmed
down little by little, and she picked up the hair from the
ground and bound it together and braided it into great
ropes, not without kissing it and lamenting over it many
times. The Mayor and the Mayoress returned, he with the
money and she with the every-day clothes of Maria, who
undressed and folded her white robe in a kerchief, put on
her old gown, hid herself with her shawl to the eyes, and
walked, moaning, to the house of the Moor, without noticing
that the man with the hood over his head was following
behind her, and that when she, in a moment of forgetfulness,
lowered her shawl through the habit she had of displaying
her tresses, her bald head could be plainly seen.
The Moor received the five hundred maravedies with that
good will with which money is always received, and told
Maria to bring Juan Lanas to his house to stay there so
long as there was any risk in the cure. Maria went to fetch
the old man, and kept silence as to her shorn head so
as not to grieve him, and whilst Juan remained the
physicia guest, Maria durst not leave her home except
after nightfall and then well enveloped; this, however, did
not hinder her being followed by the muffled-up man.</p>
<p>One evening the Moor told her in secret that the next
morning he would remove the bandages from Jua eyes.
Maria went to bed that night with great rejoicing, but
thought to herself that when her father saw her (which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
would be with no little pleasure) he would be pleased three
or four times more if he could see her with the pretty head-dress
which she used to wear in her native town. Amidst
such cavillation she donned the next day her best petticoat
and ribands to hie to the Arabia house; and while she was
sitting down to shoe herself she of a sudden felt something
like a hood closing over her head, and, turning round, she
saw behind her the muffled-up man of before, who, throwing
aside his cloak, discovered himself to be the sword-cutler,
Master Palomo, who, without speaking, presented Maria
with a little Venetian mirror, in which she looked and saw
herself with her own hair and garb in such wise that she
wondered for a good time if it were not a dream that the
Mayoress had shorn her. The fact was, that Master
Palomo was a great crony of the old woman barber, and
had seen in her house Mari tresses on the very same afternoon
of the morning in which he saw Maria was bald, and
keeping silence upon the matter, had wheedled the old
woman into keeping Mari hair for him, and dressing for
the Mayoress some other hair of the same hue which the
crone had from a dead woman—a bargain by which the
crafty old dame acquired many a bright crown. And the
story relates that as soon as Maria regained her much-lamented
and sighed-for hair by the hands of the gallant
sword-cutler, the Master appeared to her much less ugly
than before, and I do not know if it tells that from that
moment she began to look on him with more favourable eyes,
but i’sooth it is a fact that upon his asking her to accept his
escort to the Moor’s house, she gave her assent, and the
two set out hand in hand, the maiden holding her head up
free from mufflers. As they both entered the physicia
apartment her father threw himself into Mari arms,
crying—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>
<p>“Glory to God, I see thee now, my beloved daughter.
How tall and beautiful thou art grown! Verily, it is worthwhile
to become blind for five years to see on daughter
matured thus! Now that I see daylight again, it is only
right that I should no longer be a burden to thee. I shall
work for myself, for as for thee it is already time for thee to
marry.”</p>
<p>“For this very purpose am I come,” broke in at this
opportune moment the silent sword-cutler; “I, as you will
have already recognised by my voice, am your neighbour,
Master Palomo. I love Maria, and ask you for her hand.”</p>
<p>“Lack-a-day, Master, but your exterior is not very prepossessing.
Howbeit, if Maria doth accept you, I am
content.”</p>
<p>“I,” replied Maria, wholly abashed, and smoothing the
false hair (which then weighed upon her head and heart like
a burden of five hundred weight)—“I, so may God enlighten
me, for I durst not venture to reply.”</p>
<p>Palomo took her right hand without saying anything, and
as he did so Maria looked at the Master’s  wrists, and
observed the wristbands of his shirt, neatly embroidered,
and with some suspicion and beating of her heart said to
him—</p>
<p>“If you wish to please me, good neighbour, tell me by
what sempstress is this work?”</p>
<p>“It is the work,” replied the Master, jocularly—“the work
of a pretty maiden who for five years has toiled for my
person, albeit she hath not known it till now.”</p>
<p>“Now I perceive,” said Maria, “how that all the women
who have come to give me linen to sew and embroider were
sent by you, and that is why they paid me more than is
customary.”</p>
<p>The Master did not reply, but he smiled and held out
his arms to Maria. Maria threw herself into them,
embracing him very caressingly; and Juan himself said to
the two—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>
<p>“In good sooth, you are made one for the other.”</p>
<p>“By my troth, my beloved one,” continued the sword-cutler
after a while, “if my countenance had only been
more pleasing, I should not have been silent towards you
for so many long days, nor would I have been content with
gazing at you from afar. I should have spoken to you, you
would have made me the confidant of your troubles, and I
would have given you the five hundred maravedies for the
cure of your good father.” And whispering softly into her
ear, he added, “And then you would not have passed that
evil moment under the hands of the Mayoress. But if you
fear that she may break the promise she made to you to
keep silence as to your cropped head, let us, if it please you,
set out for Seville, where nobody knows you, and thus——”</p>
<p>“No more,” exclaimed Maria, resolutely throwing on the
ground the hair, which Juan picked up all astonished;
“Send this hair to the Mayoress, since it was for this and
not for that of the dead woman that she paid so dearly.
For I, to cure myself of my vanity, now make a vow, with
your good permission, to go shorn all my life; such artificial
adornments are little befitting to the wives of honest
burghers.”</p>
<p>“But rely upon it,” replied the Master-cutler, “that as
soon as it is known that you have no hair, the girls of the
city, envious of your beauty, will give you the nickname of
<i>Mariquita the Bald</i>!”</p>
<p>“They may do so,” replied Maria, “and that they may
see that I do not care a fig for this or any other nickname,
I swear to you that from this day forth I will not suffer anybody
to call me by another name than <i>Mariquita the Bald</i>.”</p>
<p>This was the event that rendered so famous throughout
all Castille the beautiful daughter of good Juan Lanas, who
in effect married Master Palomo, and became one of the
most honourable and prolific women of the most illustrious
city of Toledo.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">T<span class="smcap">hrough</span> the little square of St. Anna, towards a
certain tavern, where the best wine is to be quaffed
in Seville, there walked in measured steps two men, whose
demeanour clearly manifested the soil which gave them
birth. He who walked in the middle of the street, taller
than the other by about a finger’s length, sported with
affected carelessness the wide, slouched hat of Ecija, with
tassels of glass beads and a ribbon as black as his sins.
He wore his cloak gathered under his left arm; the right,
emerging from a turquoise lining, exposed the merino lambskin
with silver clasps. The herdsman’s boots—white, with
Turkish buttons,—the breeches gleaming red from below
the cloak and covering the knee, and, above all, his strong
and robust appearance, dark curly hair, and eye like a red-hot
coal, proclaimed at a distance that all this combination
belonged to one of those men who put an end to horses
between their knees and tire out the bull with their lance.
He walked on, arguing with his companion, who was rather
spare than prodigal in his person, but marvellously lithe
and supple. The latter was shod with low shoes, garters
united the stockings to the light-blue breeches, the waistcoat
was cane-coloured, his sash light green, and jaunty
shoulder-knots, lappets, and rows of buttons ornamented
the camelite jacket. The open cloak, the hat drawn over
his ear, his short, clean steps, and the manifestations in all
his limbs and movements of agility and elasticity beyond
trial plainly showed that in the arena, carmine cloth in
hand, he would mock at the most frenzied of Jarama bulls,
or the best horned beasts from Utrera.</p>
<p>I—who adore and die for such people, though the compliment
be not returned—went slowly in the wake of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
worships, and, unable to restrain myself, entered with them
the same tavern, or rather eating-house, since there they
serve certain provocatives as well as wine, and I, as my
readers perceive, love to call things by their right name. I
entered and sat down at once, and in such a manner as not
to interrupt my Oliver and Roland, and that they might not
notice me, when I saw that, as if believing themselves alone,
they threw their arms with an amicable gesture round each
other’s neck, and thus began their discourse:—</p>
<p>“Pulpete,” said the taller, “now that we are going to
meet each other, knife in hand—you here, I there, ... <i>one,
two, ... on your guard, ... triz, traz, ... have that,
... take this and call it what you like</i> ...—let us first
drain a tankard to the music and measure of some songs.”</p>
<p>“Señor Balbeja,” replied Pulpete, drawing his face aside
and spitting with the greatest neatness and pulchritude
towards his shoe, “I am not the kind of man either for la
Gorja or other similar earthly matters, or because a steel
tongue is sheathed in my body, or my weasand slit, or for
any other such trifle, to be provoked or vexed with such a
friend as Balbeja. Let the wine be brought, and then we
will sing; and afterwards blood—blood to the hilt.”</p>
<p>The order was given, they clinked glasses, and, looking
one at the other, sang a Sevillian song.</p>
<p>This done, they threw off their cloaks with an easy grace,
and unsheathed their knives with which to prick one another,
the one Flemish with a white haft, the other from Guadix,
with a guard to the hilt, both blades dazzling in their
brightness, and sharpened and ground enough for operating
upon cataracts, much less ripping up bellies and bowels. The
two had already cleft the air several times with the said
lancets, their cloak wound round their left arm—first drawing
closer, then back, now more boldly and in bounds—when
Pulpete hoisted the flag for parley, and said—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>
<p>“Balbeja, my friend, I only beg you to do me the favour
not to fan my face <i>Juilon</i> your knife, since a slash might
use it so ill that my mother who bore me would not know
me, and I should not like to be considered ugly; neither is
it right to mar and destroy what God made in His likeness.”</p>
<p>“Agreed,” replied Balbeja; “I will aim lower.”</p>
<p>“Except—except my stomach also, for I was ever a friend
to cleanliness, and I should not like to see myself fouled in
a bad way, if your knife and arm played havoc with my liver
and intestines.”</p>
<p>“I will strike higher; but let us go on.”</p>
<p>“Take care of my chest, it was always weak.”</p>
<p>“Then just tell me, friend, <i>where</i> am I to sound or tap
you?”</p>
<p>“My dear Balbeja, ther always plenty of time and
space to hack at a man: I have here on my left arm a wen,
of which you can make meat as much as you like.”</p>
<p>“Here goes for it,” said Balbeja, and he hurled himself
like an arrow; the other warded off the thrust with his
cloak, and both, like skilful penmen, began again tracing
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">and signatures in the air with dashes and flourishes,</span><br>
without, however, raising a particle of skin.</p>
<p>I do not know what would have been the end of this
onslaught, since my venerable, dry, and shrivelled person
was not suitable for forming a point of exclamation between
two combatants; and the tavern-keeper troubled so little
about what was happening that he drowned the stamping of
their feet and clatter of the tumbling stools and utensils by
scraping street music on a guitar as loud as he could.
Otherwise he was as calm as if he were entertaining two
angels instead of two devils incarnate.</p>
<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="illus-b210">

<div class="caption">“INCREASED THEIR FEINTS, FLOURISHES, CURVETS, CROUCHINGS,
AND BOUNDS.”</div>
</div>
<p>I do not know, I repeat, how this scene would have
ended, when there crossed the threshold a personage who
came to take a part in the development of the drama.
There entered, I say, a woman of twenty to twenty-two
years of age, diminutive in body, superlative in audacity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
and grace. Neat and clean hose and shoes, short, black
flounced petticoat, a linked girdle, head-dress or mantilla of
fringed taffeta caught together at the nape of her neck, and
a corner of it over her shoulder, she passed before my eyes
with swaying hips, arms akimbo, and moving her head to
and fro as she looked about her on all sides.</p>
<p>Upon seeing her the tavern-keeper dropped his instrument,
and I was overtaken by perturbation such as I had
not experienced for thirty years (I am, after all, only flesh
and blood); but, without halting for such lay-figures, she
advanced to the field of battle.</p>
<p>There was a lively to-do here: Don Pulpete and Don
Balbeja when they saw Doña Gorja appear, first cause of
the disturbance and future prize for the victor, increased
their feints, flourishes, curvets, onsets, crouching, and bounds—all,
however, without touching a hair. Our Helen witnessed
in silence for a long time this scene in history with
that feminine pleasure which the daughters of Eve enjoy
at such critical moments. But gradually her pretty brow
clouded over, until, drawing from her delicate ear, not a
flower or earring, but the stump of a cigar, she hurled it
amidst the jousters. Not even Charles V.’s cane in the last
duel in Spain produced such favourable effects. Both came
forward immediately with formal respect, and each, by reason
of the discomposure of his person and clothes, presumed to
urge a title by which to recommend himself to the fair with
the flounces. She, as though pensive, was going over the
passage of arms in her mind, and then, with firm and confident
resolution, spoke thus—</p>
<p>“And is this affair for me?”</p>
<p>“Who else should it be for? since I ... since nobody——”
they replied in the same breath.</p>
<p>“Listen, gentlemen,” said she. “For females such as I
and my parts, of my charms and descent—daughter of la
Gatusa, niece of la Méndez, and granddaughter of la Astrosa—know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
that there are neither pacts nor compacts, nor
any such futile things, nor are any of them worth a farthing.
And when men challenge each other, let the knife do its
work and the red blood flow, so as not to have my mother’s
daughter present without giving her the pleasure of snapping
her fingers in the face of the other. If you pretend you are
fighting for me, it’s a lie; you are wholly mistaken, and
that not by halves. I love neither of you. Mingalarios of
Zafra is to my taste, and he and I look upon you with scorn
and contempt. Good-bye, my braves; and, if you like, call
my man to account.”</p>
<p>She spoke, spat, smoothed the saliva with the point of
her shoe, looking Pulpete and Balbeja full in the face, and
went out with the same expressive movements with which
she entered.</p>
<p>The two unvarnished braggarts followed the valorous
Doña Gorja with their eyes; and then with a despicable
gesture drew their knives across their sleeve as though
wiping off the blood there might have been, sheathed them
at one and the same time, and said together—</p>
<p>“Through woman the world was lost, through a woman
Spain was lost;<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_9" id="FNanchor_9">[9]</a> but it has never been known, nor do ballads
relate, nor the blind beggars sing,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_10" id="FNanchor_10">[10]</a> nor is it heard in the
square or markets, that two valiant men killed each other
for another lover.”</p>
<p>“Give me that fist, Don Pulpete.”</p>
<p>“Your hand, Don Balbeja.”</p>
<p>They spoke and strode out into the street, the best friends
in the world, leaving me all amazed at such whimsicality.</p>

husband tells it, for he stayed at home with Alfonsa
and the baby, who was asleep, and he knew nothing about
what happened.”</p>
<p>“Then, do you tell me how it happened.”</p>
<p>“I, sir? Well, you see, your Worship,  an honest
woman and do know how to explain myself well; but
that gentleman there is my husband, and his conduct is
such as your Honour sees, always drunk and out of work.”</p>
<p>“Come to the point.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m coming; the cause of it all is a friend of the
family and very intimate, as every one knows, and they call
him Malgesto, and he can thrust a banderilla<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_11" id="FNanchor_11">[11]</a> into the
morning star, much less into a bull; well, as I was saying,
the same had told me: ‘Paca, I won’t have my lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
friends look at el Chato, and if I see them do it, I’ll cut
off the little nose he has left.’“All right!” said I, “but as
you see, your Lordship or your Worship, taste is taste,
and in no catechism have I seen it called a sin to look at
somebody; so la Curra, who evil tongues say is Malgesto’s
wife, and I paid no attention, you see, and....”</p>
<p>“Go on, you went to the bull-fight with the other man.”</p>
<p>“Tha just it, since he hired a fly and took me and la
Curra, so that we might not go alone, and everybody
would have done the same, and I....”</p>
<p>“To the point, to the point.”</p>
<p>“The point is a needle’s point, as one says, for take my
word for it, the other from the arena never takes his eyes
off us the whole time, and he placed the darts in a cross,
and cursed them with gestures towards us, from which
Heaven deliver us.”</p>
<p>“But at last....”</p>
<p>“At last the last bull was despatched as usual, and we
all went away in peace and the grace of God, when as we
were going out el Chato disappeared somehow, and I who
expected to meet him at the door of the fly, who do you
think I met? nobody more nor less than the banderillero,
who said, ‘Ungrateful woman, is this how you obey my
orders?’I said to him ... but no, I said nothing to
him then, as if I were afraid, but I just shrugged my
shoulders, and I do know if I did anything else. He
answered nothing, except two or three oaths and a little
blasphemy, and then seizing la Curra, he lifted her
violently into the cab, and then he pushed me in, saying:
‘If you do go in I’ll kill el Chato’ and I, you see,
your Honour,  a decent woman, and do want anybody’s
death.”</p>
<p>“And so what did you do?”</p>
<p>“What could I do? I got in.”</p>
<p>“And afterwards?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>
<p>“Afterwards came the row, for la Curra began to grumble,
and so did I, he to keep us quiet gave us each two or three
cuffs; and then we began to call him names and call each
other names, for your Honour knows defence is only
natural; to finish up, the horse took fright and nearly upset
us; but at last we got out in the Calle del Barquillo; he set
off running, la Curra after him, and tha the last I’ve seen
of them.”</p>
<p>“So that you have nothing more to allege?”</p>
<p>“Nothing more.”</p>
<p>“And you swear to this?”</p>
<p>“I swear that I am a respectable woman, incapable of
scandalous behaviour, though at times a poor female ca
help ... but now I want to complain to your Worship, for
I too have my wrongs.”</p>
<p>“Let us hear them.”</p>
<p>“In the first place I complain of all my neighbours, for
they have stolen all I had in the house, inside and outside.”</p>
<p>“And how can you prove?”</p>
<p>“I can prove the things are gone, which is the principal
thing; secondly, I complain of my husband, who does
protect me in my danger; thirdly, I complain of la Curra
for fourteen scratches and ten pinches, not to mention
some kicks; besides this I complain of the policeman,
who took me to prison only because I pulled a face at him
on St. Anthony’s day,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_12" id="FNanchor_12">[12]</a> when he tried to make love to me;
lastly, I complain of your Worship, who are Justice of the

<h2 class="nobreak" id="DELIGHTS_OF_A_MADRID_WINTER"> <i>DELIGHTS OF A MADRID WINTER.</i></h2>
</div>
<p class="drop-cap">N<span class="smcap">o</span>, sir, you cannot deny that the best season of the
year is winter. The theatres fill up. Gastronomists
return to the juicy oyster; and as soon as it begins
to freeze still their appetites with the tasty sea-bream. The
crown ministers can infringe the laws with impunity,
fearless of tumults and insurrections, for the people’s blood
does not boil as in the month of July, and patriots prefer
roasting chestnuts and toasting themselves over the brazier
to haranguing in rain and snow. The shoeblacks dance
with joy, for the mud is all in their favour. The doctors
make their fortunes with colds and lung diseases. The
apothecaries sell cough lozenges to their hearts’ content.
The maid-servants make a new conquest every day of the
Savoyards who cross the Pyrenees to clean out our chimneys
and purses with their monkeys and hurdy-gurdies. But
besides these and other votaries, who have powerful
reasons for liking winter, there are other admirers of this
season dubbed <i>rigorous</i> by the ignorant vulgar. These
devotees are the only really intelligent beings, and nobody
will be able to deny they are right, when they patent the
advantages of the months of November, December, and
January over those of May, June, and July.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>
<p>The monotony of summer is insipid. The sun shines
upon everything with the very same rays. The flowers unceasingly
diffuse the identical scent. The country is always
green.... It is unsupportable, horrible! The votaries
of summer say that all this makes the little birds charm
with their trills and warbles every heart sensible to the
delights of harmony. And we defenders of winter reply,
who can compare the feeble song of the timid nightingale
to the animated and piercing duets intoned by enamoured
cats on our roofs in January? And the rain? Can anything
be more delicious than rain? Oh, how I rave for the
rain! Let us talk about the rain!</p>
<p>Some people say the rain is monotonous. Ignorant
idiots! Let them apply that epithet to the sun, but the
rain—monotonous? Bah! Could anybody adduce anything
more varied and agreeable than rain? Clouds,
mists, dew, hail, drizzle, showers, snow-storms ... what a
charming mosaic of precious things!</p>
<p>Is there a more sublime spectacle than a shower? ...
especially when contemplated from behind a well-glazed
window? When the cataracts of heaven are opened on
Sundays, it is worth while hiring a balcony in the Puerta
del Sol. Those who have been so imprudent as to sally
out without their wife and umbrella, recognise the advantage
of the latter article over the former. But what a pleasing
sight is the picturesque group of a married pair and their
little children under the protection of one umbrella! And
when the crystalline rain is accompanied by a strong soester,
which the most impermeable of taffety cannot resist—that
boisterous blast which removes hats and wigs ... oh,
then the respectable couple who have issued forth to air
their Sunday-best present a marvellous and really romantic
spectacle. The husband, fearful for his precious umbrella
abandons the arm of his better-half, and presses his feet
firmly to the ground to save the article in question, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
wind has turned it inside out like a stocking, and seems
desirous of snatching it from his hands, in the same way
that it has whirled off his hat just as a flower-pot falls from
one of the houses and smashes his skull. The modest
spouse pays no attention either to her husband’s catastrophe,
or to the gusts or downpour, but thinks only
of her angelical prudicity, and how she may best avoid
making a display of her person, for the wind against which
she is struggling marks out all her contour, seeming to take
a pleasure in exposing to the spectators the most hidden
curves of his victim.</p>
<p>But I should never end if I gave a minute description of
all the fascinations of my favourite season. I have said
enough about the beauties of rain. In another article I
hope to illustrate the pleasures of the cold, the charm of
chilblains, and particularly all tha heroic in cerebral
rheums, fully persuaded that once the reasons upon which
I base my opinions are read, all my readers will agree
with me that there is nothing to be compared with the
delights of winter.</p>

parliamentary representative of some rural
locality. “Why my constituency would recognise me
in that portrait. It’s detestable!”</p>
<p>“It’s excellent!” replied the exasperated photographer.
“There’s not a better photographer than myself in Madrid.”</p>
<p>“I do doubt it; but it’s clear you have not been successful

<p>“Again, is my neck black?”</p>
<p>“That is the shade....”</p>
<p>“No imputations, sir! ther nothing shady in me or
my political life, and in my district they will tell you who
I am; and if, though I am mayor, I never served my two
years in the militia, why....”</p>
<p>“But the photograph, the photograph!”</p>
<p>“The photograph is not like me.”</p>
<p>“Then you wo take it?”</p>
<p>“No, sir.”</p>
<p>“Good; then I shall put it in the window, with the inscription,
‘The original of this is a cheat.’”</p>
<p>“You can do it....”</p>
<p>“Everybody who knows you....”</p>
<p>“Who would recognise me?... My electors know
perfectly well that I have two eyes and two ears.”</p>
<p>“Then go, sir, in Heave name.”</p>
<p>“And to think that people say photography is so true
to life!” growled, as he departed, this father of his
country.</p>
<p>“Number 25,” cried the manservant, putting his head in
at the door of the waiting-room.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>
<p>And Number 25, who is not a bad-looking lady, passes
through the corridor and enters the studio.</p>
<p>The photographer bows, and the following conversation
begins:—</p>
<p>“Sir,” said the lady, “my happiness lies in your hands.”</p>
<p>“I am very pleased,  sure; but I do quite understand....”</p>
<p>“I am a single lady, sir, as yet single....”</p>
<p>“Been so long?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon, I mean ...  at your service.”</p>
<p>“I must tell you that a gentleman I do not love wants
to marry me perforce.... He resides at Havana, and I
do not wish to have my husband so far away.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>“Now, tell me, if a man persisted in marrying you from
Havana....”</p>
<p>“The hypothesis is not admissible, mm.”</p>
<p>“Ah, true! well, if a woman....”</p>
<p>“There are matters, madam, in which the person interested
can alone....”</p>
<p>“It is true; for this reason, wishing at all costs to break
off the projected marriage, I have determined to send my
likeness to my suitor.”</p>
<p>“Your looks, mm, will captivate him more than ever.”</p>
<p>“That’s why; ... I wish my likeness not to be my
likeness: I want to come out ugly, very ugly.”</p>
<p>“That’s impossible, madam; photography always tells
the truth.”</p>
<p>“Do you refuse?”</p>
<p>“Decidedly. Even if I tried you would not come out
ugly.”</p>
<p>“That’s what my cousin the lieutenant says.”</p>
<p>“And he’s right.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>
<p>“But I must carry out my plan, and if you will not do it
I shall go to a photographer I saw in the Calle de Francia,
where some hideous women are exhibited.”</p>
<p>“As you like, madam.”</p>
<p>The lady withdraws, and the manservant calls out,
“Number 26.”</p>
<p>Number 26 is a stalwart country bumpkin in a russet suit,
who, after entering the studio, is asked if he desires his
photograph on a card or on glass.</p>
<p>“I want those that cost twelve reals by the notice,” says he.</p>
<p>“Good. Sit down in that chair.”</p>
<p>“But it must be exactly like me; I give you warning.”</p>
<p>“You will see, sir.”</p>
<p>“And I must appear in the fancy dress I wear at home
in our village for the Carnival.”</p>
<p>“Have you brought it with you?”</p>
<p>“No; ought I to have?”</p>
<p>“Most certainly.”</p>
<p>“Take me now, and the first time I come to Madrid
again I’ll bring the dress.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">S<span class="smcap">ince</span> I have grown older I very seldom care to change
the order of my way of living, which has now been
settled a long time, and I base this repugnance upon the
fact that I have never for a single day abandoned my Lares
to break my system without being overtaken by a most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
sincere repentance as the presumption of my deluded hopes.
Nevertheless a remnant of the old-fashioned courtesy adopted
by our forefathers in their intercourse obliges me at times to
accept certain invitations, which to refuse would be rudeness,
or at least a ridiculous affectation of delicacy.</p>
<p>Some days ago I was walking through the streets in search
of material for my articles. Buried in my thoughts, I surprised
myself several times, laughing like a poor wretch at
my own fancies, and mechanically moving my lips. A
stumble or so reminded me now and again that to walk
on the pavements of Madrid it is not the best of circumstances
to be either poet or philosopher; more than one
malicious smile, more than one look of wonder from the
passers-by, made me reflect that soliloquies should not be
made in public; and when turning corners not a few collisions
with those who turned them as heedlessly as I made
me recognise that the absent-minded are not among the
number of elastic bodies, much less among glorious and
impassable beings. Such being my frame of mind, imagine
my sensations upon receiving a horrible smack which a huge
hand attached (it seemed to me) to a brawny arm administered
to one of my shoulders, which unfortunately bear not
the slightest resemblance to those of Atlas!</p>
<p>Not wishing to make it understood that I would not
recognise this energetic way of announcing on self, nor to
rebuff the goodwill, which doubtless wished to show itself
to be more than mediocre by leaving me crooked for the
rest of the day, I was merely about to turn round to see
who was so much my friend as to treat me so badly. But
my Old Castilian is a man who, when he is joking, does not
stop half-way. What? my reader will ask. He gave further
proofs of his intimacy and affection? He clasped his hands
tightly over my eyes from behind, crying out, “Who am I?”
bubbling over with delight at the success of his pretty trick.
“Who you are? A brute,” I was about to reply; but I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
suddenly remembered who it might be, and substituted the
words, “I Braulio.” Upon hearing me he loosened his
hands, held his sides for laughter, disturbing the whole
street, and making us both very conspicuous.</p>
<p>“Good, good! How did you recognise me?”</p>
<p>“Who could it be but you?...”</p>
<p>“Well, so you’ve come from your dear Biscay?”</p>
<p>“No, Braulio, I have not come?”</p>
<p>“Always the same merry humour. What does it matter?
I a way we have of talking in Spain.... Do you know
it’s my birthday to-morrow?”</p>
<p>“I wish you many happy returns of the day.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no formalities between us; you know  a plain
fellow and an Old Castilian, and call a spade a spade; consequently
I require no compliments from you, but consider
yourself invited——”</p>
<p>“To what?”</p>
<p>“To dine with me.”</p>
<p>“Impossible.”</p>
<p>“You must.”</p>
<p>“I cannot,” I insist, trembling.</p>
<p>“You ca?”</p>
<p>“Very many thanks——”</p>
<p>“Thanks? Very well, my dear friend; as  not the
Duke of F., or Count P., of course——”</p>
<p>Who can resist an attack of this kind? Who cares to
appear proud? “It is not that, but——”</p>
<p>“Well, if it’s not that,” he breaks in, “I shall expect
you at two. We dine early at my house—Spanish style.
I expect a lot of people; there will be the famous improvisor
X.; T. will sing after dinner in his usual first-rate
style; and in the evening J. will play and sing some
trifles.”</p>
<p>This consoled me somewhat, and I had to give way.
“Everybody,” said I to myself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span> “has an evil day sometimes.
In this world, if one wishes to preserve friends, one must
endure their civilities.”</p>
<p>“You wo fail, unless you want to quarrel with me?”</p>
<p>“I shall not fail,” I said in a lifeless voice and low spirits,
like a fox vainly revolving in the trap in which it has allowed
itself to be caught.</p>
<p>“Then good-bye till to-morrow,” and he gave me a
parting slap.</p>
<p>I watched him go as the sower watches the decreasing
cloud of his seed, and remained wondering how one should
take such adverse and fatal friendships.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Two lock arrived. As I knew my friend Braulio, I
did not think it advisable to make myself too fine for his
party; that, I am sure, would have annoyed him; nevertheless
I could not dispense with a light frock-coat and a white
pocket-handkerchief as essential for such birthday festivities.
Above all, I dressed myself as slowly as possible, like the
wretched criminal confessing at the foot of the gallows, who
would like to have committed a hundred more sins the
which to confess in order to gain more time. I was invited
at two, and I entered the state-parlour at half-past two.</p>
<p>I will not dwell on the ceremonious calls made before
dinner-time by an infinite number of visitors, among which
were not least all the officials of his department with their
spouses and children, their cloaks, umbrellas, galoshes, and
house-dogs; I will be silent as to the foolish compliments
paid to the head of the family on his birthday, nor describe
the monstrous circle which was formed in the parlour by
the assembly of so many heterogeneous people, discoursing
upon how the weather was about to change, and how the
winter is generally colder than the summer. Let us come
to the point: four lock struck, and we, the invited guests,
found ourselves alone. Unluckily for me, Señor X., who
was to have entertained us, being a connoisseur of this class<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
of invitation, had had the good idea to fall sick that morning;
the celebrated T. found himself opportunely compromised
by another invitation, and the young lady who was to sing
and play so well was hoarse to such a degree that she was
appalled lest a single word should drop from her lips, while
she had a rag round one of her fingers. Alas, for my beguiled
expectations!</p>
<p>“I suppose all who are to dine are here,” exclaimed Don
Braulio. “Let us go to table, my dear.”</p>
<p>“Wait a bit,” replied his wife in a loud whisper. “Such a
lot of callers prevented my being in the kitchen, and....”</p>
<p>“But, look, it’s  five lock....”</p>
<p>“Dinner will be ready in a moment....”</p>
<p>It was five lock when we sat down.</p>
<p>“Ladies and gentleman,” said our amphitryon, as we
staggered into our respective chairs, “I insist upon your
making yourselves quite at home; we do stand upon
ceremony in my house. Oh, Figaro! I want <i>you</i> to be
quite comfortable; you are a poet, and besides, these
gentlemen who know how intimate we are will not be
offended if I make an exception of you; take off your coat;
it wo do to stain it.”</p>
<p>“Why should I stain it?” I replied, biting my lips.</p>
<p>“Oh, tha all right; I’ll lend you a loose jacket;
sorry I have one for everybody.”</p>
<p>“I’d sooner not, thank you.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense! My jacket! Here it is; it will be a little
large for you!”</p>
<p>“But, Braulio....”</p>
<p>“You must have it—bother etiquette!” and he thereupon
pulled off my coat himself, <i>velis nolis</i>, and buried me in a
great striped jacket, through which only my feet and head
protruded, and the sleeves of which would probably not
permit me to eat. I thanked him; he thought he was doing
me a favour.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span></p>
<p>The days upon which my friend has no visitors he
contents himself with a low table, little more than a
cobble bench, because he and his wife, as he says, what
should they want more? From this little table he carries
his food, like water drawn up a well, to his mouth, where it
arrives dripping after its long journey; for to imagine that
these people keep a proper table and eat comfortably every
day in the year is to expect too much. It is easy, therefore,
to conceive that the installations of a large table for a dinner-party
was an event in that house, so much so that a table at
which scarcely eight people could have eaten comfortably
had been considered capable of sitting the whole fourteen
of us. We had to sit sideways with one shoulder towards
the dinner, and the elbows of the guests entered on intimate
relationship with each other in the most confiding fashion
possible. They put me as in a place of honour between a
child five years old, raised on some cushions, which I had
to arrange every minute, as the natural restlessness of my
youthful neighbour caused them to slip, and one of those
men that occupy in this world the room of three, whose
corpulency rose from the basis of the armchair (the only
one) in which he was sitting as from the point of a needle.
The table-napkins which we silently unfolded were new, for
they were just as little commodities of daily use, and were
pulled by these good gentlemen through a button-hole of
their frock-coats to serve as intermediary bodies between
the sauces and their broadcloth.</p>
<p>“You will have to do penance, gentlemen,” exclaimed
our amphitryon as soon as he had sat down.</p>
<p>“What ridiculous affectation if untrue,” said I to myself;
“and if it is true, what folly to invite on friends to do
penance.” Unfortunately it was not long before I knew
that there was in that expression more truth than my good
Braulio imagined. Interminable and of poor taste were the
compliments with which, upon passing and receiving each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
dish, we wearied one another. “Pray help yourself.” “Do
me the favour.” “I could think of it.” “Pass it on to
the lady.” “Ah, tha right.” “Pardon me.” “Thank you.”</p>
<p>“No ceremony, gentlemen,” exclaimed Braulio, and was
the first to dip his spoon into his plate.</p>
<p>The soup was followed by an olla, an assortment of the
most savoury impertinences of that most annoying but
excellent dish; here was some meat, there some green stuff;
here the dried beans,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_13" id="FNanchor_13">[13]</a> there the ham; the chicken to the
right, the bacon in the middle, and the Estremaduran
sausage to the left. Then came some larded veal, upon
which may the curse of Heaven alight, and after this
another dish, and another and another and another, half of
which were brought over from an hotel, which will suffice to
excuse our praising them, the other half made at home by
their own maid and a Biscayan wench, a help hired for this
festivity, and the mistress of the house, who on such occasions
is supposed to have a hand in everything, and can
consequently superintend nothing properly.</p>
<p>“You must be indulgent with this dish,” said the latter of
some pigeons, “they are a little burnt.”</p>
<p>“But, my dear....”</p>
<p>“I only left them for a moment, and you know what
servants are.”</p>
<p>“What a pity this turkey was not half an hour longer
before the fire! It was put down too late. And do
you think that stew is a little smoked?”</p>
<p>“What can you expect? A woman ca be everywhere
at once.”</p>
<p>“Oh, thee excellent!” we all exclaimed, leaving the
pieces on our plates—“delicious!”</p>
<p>“This fish is bad.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>
<p>“Well, they said in the office of the fresh fish delivery
that it had only just arrived; the man there is so stupid!”</p>
<p>“Where does this wine come from?”</p>
<p>“Now there yoe wrong, for it’s....”</p>
<p>“Detestable.”</p>
<p>These short dialogues were accompanied by a number of
furtive glances from the husband to acquaint his wife of
some negligence, and both tried to give us to understand
that they were quite at home in all those formulæ which in
similar cases are reputed correct, and that all the blunders
were the fault of the servants, who can never learn to wait.
But these omissions were so numerous, and looks were of
such little avail, that the husband had recourse to pinches
and kicks, and his wife, who, until the present, had barely
succeeded in rising superior to her spouse’s persecution,
now became inflamed in the face, and had tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Dear madam, do not distress yourself about such trifles,”
said her neighbour.</p>
<p>“Ah! I assure you I shall not do this kind of thing in
the house again; you do know what it means; another
time, Braulio, we’ll dine at the hotel, and then you’ll not
have....”</p>
<p>“You, madam, shall do what I....”</p>
<p>“Braulio! Braulio!”</p>
<p>A terrible storm was about to burst; however, all the
guests vied with each other in settling these disputes born
of the desire to demonstrate the greatest refinement, and of
which not the smallest components were Braulio’s mania,
and the concluding remark which he again directed to the
assembly with regard to the inutility of ceremony, by which
he understood being properly served and knowing how to
eat. Is there anything more ridiculous than those people
who wish to pass for refined in the depths of the crassest
ignorance of social usage, and who, to favour you, forcibly
oblige you to eat and drink, and will not allow you to do
what you like? And why are there people who only care
to eat with a little more comfort on birthdays?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span></p>
<p>To add to all this, the child to my left violently knocked
against a dish of ham and tomatoes a saucer of olives, of
which one hit one of my eyes, and prevented me seeing
clearly for the rest of the day; the stout gentleman to my
right had taken the precaution to heap up on the cloth
by the side of my bread the crumbs of his own and the
bones of the birds which he had picked; and the guest
opposite me, who piqued himself on his carving, had taken
upon himself to make the autopsy of a capon, or cock, for
nobody knew which, and whether by reason of the advanced
age of the victim, or the lack of anatomical science of the
executioner, the joints would not sever.</p>
<p>“This bird has no joints!” exclaimed the poor wretch,
the drops of perspiration running down his face from his
struggles, “for the carver is the labourer who digs that I
may eat,” and then a wonderful occurrence took place.
Upon one of the attacks the fork, as if in resentment,
slipped on the animal, which, thus violently despatched,
took a flight as in its happier days, and then quietly alighted
on the tablecloth, as on a roost in the poultry yard.</p>
<p>The fright was general, and the alarm reached its climax
when a sauce-boat, impelled by the bird’s wild career, upset,
splashing my snow-white shirt. At this point the carver
rose hastily, with a mind to chase the fugitive fowl, and as
he precipitated himself upon it, a bottle to the right, which
he knocked with his arm, abandoning its perpendicular
position, poured out an abundant stream of Valdepeñas<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_14" id="FNanchor_14">[14]</a>
over the capon and the cloth. The wine ran; the uproar
increased; salt was abundantly sprinkled on the top of the
wine to save the cloth; to save the table a napkin was
inserted below the cloth, and an eminence arose on the
site of so many ruins. A terrified maid-servant, who was
bidden bear away the capon, now reposing in its own gravy,
tilted the dish as she lifted it over me, and an accursed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
shower of grease descended like the dew upon the meadows
to leave lasting traces on my pearl-grey pantaloons. The
anguish and confusion of the girl are beyond bounds; she
withdraws, unsuccessful in her excuses, and, turning round,
collides with the waiter, who is carrying a dozen clean
plates and a salver for the dessert wines, and the whole
machine comes to the ground with the most horrible clatter
and commotion.</p>

</div>
<p>“By St. Peter!” roars our host, and a mortal pallor
diffused itself over his features, while a fire broke out on
his wif face. “But no matter; let us continue, friends,”
said he, calming down.</p>
<p>Oh, honest homes where a modest olla and a single dish
constitute the daily happiness of a family, shun the perturbation
of a birthday dinner-party! The custom of eating
well and being well served every day can alone avert similar
discomfiture.</p>
<p>Are there any more disasters? Alas, there are for my
miserable self! Doña Juana, the lady with the black and
yellow teeth, holds out to me from her plate and with her
own fork a dainty bit, which I am bound to accept and
swallow; the child diverts himself by shooting cherry-stones
at the eyes of the assembly; Don Leandro makes me taste
the delicious orange, which I had refused, squeezed into his
glass, which preserves the indelible traces of his greasy lips;
my fat friend is smoking, and makes me the flue of his
chimney; finally, oh last of miseries! the clamour and
uproar increase, voices already hoarse demand couplets
and stanzas, and Figaro is the only poet present.</p>
<p>“You must.” “I for you to say something,” they all
shout. “Start him with the first line; let him compose a
couplet for each of us.” “I’ll start him:</p>
<p class="center">‘To Don Braulio on this day.’”</p>
<p>“Gentlemen, for Heave sake!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>
<p>“Ther no getting out of it.”</p>
<p>“I’ve never improvised in my life.”</p>
<p>“Do play the bashful.”</p>
<p>“I shall go.”</p>
<p>“Lock the door. He sha’n’t leave the room till he
recites something.”</p>
<p>And so I repeat some verses at last, and vomit absurdities,
which they praise, and the smoke, the hubbub, and the
purgatory increases.</p>
<p>Thank Heavens, I succeed in escaping from this new
pandemonium. At last I again breathe the pure air of the
street; there are now no more lunatics, no more Old
Castilians around me.</p>
<p>“Ye gods, I thank you!” I exclaimed, breathing
freely like a stag who has just escaped a dozen dogs and
can barely hear their distant barks. “Henceforward I do
not pray for riches, office, or honours. But deliver me from
those houses in which a dinner-party is an event, in which
a decent table is only laid for visitors, in which they think
they are doing you a good turn while they are doing you a
bad one, in which they are over-polite, in which they recite
verses, in which there are children, in which there are fat
men, in which, finally, there reigns the brutal frankness of
the Old Castilians! If I fall again by similar temptations,
may I ever lack roast beef, may beefsteaks vanish from this
world, may timbales of macaroni be annihilated, may there
be no turkeys in Perigueux, nor pies in Perigord, may the
wines of Bordeaux dry up, and everybody but myself drink
the delicious foam of champagne!”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">E<span class="smcap">leven</span> was striking by the nearest clock; and as
the last stroke vibrated upon Don Liberato Plebist
tympanum an instantaneous electric commotion was transmitted
from it to his brain, which made him hastily sit up in
bed and begin to dress. He violently rubbed his eyes with
his knuckles, which, together with the use of his pocket-handkerchief
and four or five loud hollow coughs, sufficed
to cause him to regain entire possession of his senses and
natural powers, and shook him out of that kind of lethargy,
or state of doze, which between a deep sleep and being
wide awake occupies the function of a scruple.</p>
<p>He had fallen asleep with a fixed idea that he must rise
early to write a long, forcible, and brilliant article, and
seeing the sun already so advanced on its course, he jumped
out of bed, and made towards his study in a rich dressing-gown
and canvas slippers delicately embroidered by some
feminine hand. He leaned back in an armchair before a
solid mahogany writing-table, pulled the bell loudly three
times by a silken rope; a footman appeared, who placed
upon the table the silver brazier with some large red-hot
pieces of charcoal; and then, when he had demanded
breakfast with an imperative manner, and the man had
withdrawn, Don Liberato lit a fragrant Havana, seized it
between his teeth, grasped the pen with his right hand,
rested his brow on his left, and leaning his elbow on the
desk and gently tapping his right foot on the carpet, as if
to excite ideas by this slight motion, remained in this
attitude for five minutes, at the end of which he put his
pen to paper and began to write to the following effect:—</p>
<p>“The incarnate enemies of the unhappy people—those
wicked and egoistic men, who live under the shadow of
privileges (<i>Don Liberato smiled to himself</i>) and grow fat with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
the substance of the poor—take very good care in all their
writings and perorations to speak of nothing but principles
and political questions, more or less metaphysical and
vague, astutely keeping silence when there is any reference
to social questions, upon which is actually based the
revolution, which in this our age agitates Spain, disturbs
Europe, and threatens the world.”</p>
<p>(<i>Liberato, savouring the sonority of this rounded period,
expelled from his cigar a dense cloud of azure and aromatic
smoke ... and continued writing.</i>)</p>
<p>“The priority of certain castes, the inequality with which
property is distributed, the malign influence of priesthood,
the tyranny of the rich and potential over the masses, and
other thousand obstacles which oppose the felicity of the
people, are those which must be destroyed, but with regard
to which the partisans of abuses ever succeed in embroiling
a discussion. You, unhappy day-labourers, unfortunate
artisans, fathers of a numerous family, who to gain bread
for your unfortunate offspring must abandon your narrow
bed at break of day....”</p>
<p>(<i>At this moment Don Liberato’s clock struck a quarter to
twelve, and the rays of the noonday sun, penetrating the green
curtains, succeeded in bathing with light the richly furnished
room of the journalist, who went on writing thus</i>):—</p>
<p>“You will tell me if what interests you most is to discuss
the preference for this or that method of electing representatives,
or, on the contrary, the monstrous superiority of
the potentate swimming in pleasures, of the sensual sybarite
passing the night amidst the delicacies of the table, while
you earn with the sweat of your brow the bread you must
eat soaked in your tears.”</p>
<p>(<i>The room door is opened, and Don Liberato’s footman
enters carrying an exquisite china tea-service, with a savoury
dish, tea, milk, and buttered toast. Placing his burden on a
small table, covered with a fine white embroidered cloth, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
draws it in the greatest silence within reach of his master to
the right of the desk, and retires stealthily, so as not to
interrupt the sublime composition which continues multiplying
sheets of paper thus wise</i>):—</p>
<p>“Ye hungry and naked sons of the unfortunate Spanish
people (<i>The writer throws away the stump of the Havana,
and crams his mouth full with sweet-bread</i>) rear your naked
and hungry children with anxiety and fatigue, and rear
them to be the slaves of a rich, powerful, and proud
aristocracy....”</p>
<p>(<i>Don Liberato again smiles to himself, and devours the rest
of the sweet-bread.</i>)</p>
<p>“Rear them to till <i>their</i> land, to build <i>their</i> palaces, to
weave <i>their</i> rich clothes, to wrench from the bowels of the
earth the precious metals with which <i>their</i> ostentatious
apparel is embroidered, and <i>their</i> ornaments and furniture
covered in scandalous profusion.”</p>
<p>(<i>The writer imbibes about a quart of tea, and attacks the
buttered toast.</i>)</p>
<p>“Rear them that they may be dragged into misery with
you, while the gilded chariots of the great, bearing their
mistresses to shows and pageants, roll by, threatening to run
over them, and bespattering them with mud....”</p>
<p>“Sir,” said the Gallegan servant, entering timidly.</p>
<p>“Wha the matter?” replied Don Liberato.</p>
<p>“They have brought this letter from the lady. It is
urgent.”</p>
<p>Having read the note, he replied thus—</p>
<p>“Say, ‘very well’ and Domingo, remember to hire a
carriage for this evening at five sharp: and I ca see anybody
now, I must get on with my writing.”</p>
<p>“This, this is the real evil of society, the pitiful state of
which the present generation aspires to vary by a revolution
as glorious as just. Let those monstrous fortunes be divided
and subdivided, let them return in small capitals to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
hands of the poor people who made them. Thus these
terrible scenes of misery will not be seen which are
augmented by the scandalous neglect of the Government
for the widows and orphans of the best servants of the
State.”</p>
<p>“Sir!”</p>
<p>“What is it now?”</p>
<p>“The widow of that captain, who comes to see if
you....”</p>
<p>“D—— you and the widow; throw her downstairs, and
do open the door to every beggar.”</p>
<p>“But there also came....”</p>
<p>“Who came?—quickly.”</p>
<p>“A man with cigars, the one who brought that other
box.”</p>
<p>“Here, take these twenty-five dollars, and go to the
devil! Let us see if I can finish my article.”</p>
<p>“Meanwhile the vile aristocrats keep the people in the
most humiliating servitude, and their condition and treatment
is worse than that of cattle.”</p>
<p>“Sir.”</p>
<p>“If you do shut that door, you brute, I’ll throw the
ink-bottle at your head.”</p>
<p>“The habits of despotism which they have acquired
through the course of centuries....”</p>
<p>“But, sir, only one word....”</p>
<p>(<i>Don Liberato hurls the salver at the poor Gallegan, and
then continues scribbling with the greatest amenity until he
comes to the following words</i>):—</p>
<p>“And these errors, upheld by venal journalists....”</p>
<p>(<i>Domingo returns to the charge, preceded this time by a man
of ugly appearance, who pays Don Liberato a large sum for a
compilation. Having taken the money, and returned the
receipt, he continues</i>):—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>
<p>“And who tells these calumniators that the defence
of the people is a propensity to anarchy; that the severe
censure of deeds of despotism is an act of rebellion; and
that the struggle against fanaticism is unbelief, impiety, and
hatred of the sacred religion which we venerate more than
they?”</p>
<p>“May I go out, sir?”</p>
<p>“No, no, hang you, and by heavens if you interrupt me
again....”</p>
<p>“It is Sunday, sir, if you remember, and there is only
late mass now.”</p>
<p>“You must do without mass, I require you here.”</p>
<p>“You must take it on your conscience, sir.”</p>
<p>“And so I will, you rascal; and I may take a stick too,
and send you to hear mass in the infernal regions, that will
stop your being such a confounded hypocrite.”</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>With this last invective the scene ended between master
and man, and with a few more lines the article of our
journalist. The latter, after having dined sumptuously,
passed the evening driving with his mistress, entered a café,
where he spent a dollar or two, calling the waiter a scoundrel
and stupid idiot; went in the night to a gambling-house,
where he parted with ten gold pieces, and returned to bed
with the dawn, forming plans for heartrending articles on
the lot of the poor, and furious declamations against the
aristocracy, the rich, and the Government.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“S<span class="smcap">iseta</span>,” I said suddenly, “it is a long time since I
have seen Pussy, but I suppose she is wandering about
somewhere with her three kittens.”</p>
<p>“Oh!” she replied sorrowfully, “do you know that
Dr. Pablo has done for the whole family? Poor Pussy!
He says the flesh is excellent; but I think I would rather
die of hunger than eat her.”</p>
<p>“What? he killed Pussy? I never heard about it; and
the little kittens too?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t like to tell you. The last few days that we
have not been at home, the doctor often came in. One
day he knelt down and implored me to give him something
for his sick daughter, for he had no provisions left or money
to buy them. While he was talking one of the kittens sprang
on to my shoulder, and Don Pablo seized it quickly and
put it into his pocket. The next day he came again and
offered me his drawing-room furniture for another kitten,
and without awaiting my answer went into the kitchen,
then into the dark lobby, lay in wait and chased the kitten
like a cat after a rat. I had to bathe the scratches on his
face. The third perished in the same way, and then Pussy
disappeared from the house, probably thinking she was not
safe.”</p>
<p>I was meditating upon the desertion of the poor animal,
when Don Pablo suddenly presented himself. He was
lean and cadaverous-looking, and had lost by physical and
moral sufferings the kindly expression and gentle accent
which distinguished him. His clothes were disorderly
and torn, and he was carrying a large gun and a hunting-knife.</p>
<p>“Siseta,” he said abruptly, and forgetting to greet me,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
although we had not seen each other for several days. “I
know now where that cunning cat is.”</p>
<p>“Where is she, Don Pablo?”</p>
<p>“In the loft the other side of the yard where my corn
and straw was stored when I kept a horse.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps it is not our Pussy,” said Siseta, in her
generous desire to save the poor animal.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is, I tell you. She can’t deceive me. The sly
thing jumped in this morning through the pantry window
and stole a kitte leg hanging there. The audacity! and
to eat her own children’s flesh too. I must put an end to
her, Siseta. I have already given you a good part of my
furniture for the kittens. I have nothing valuable left
except my books of medicine. Will you have them in exchange
for the cat?”</p>
<p>“Don Pablo, I will take neither furniture nor books,
catch Pussy, and, as we are reduced to such extremities,
give part of her to my brothers.”</p>
<p>“Good. Andres, do you dare chase the animal?”</p>
<p>“I do think we want such a lot of arms,” I replied.</p>
<p>“But I do. Let us go.”</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>The doctor and I climbed to the loft, which we entered
slowly and warily, for fear we might be attacked by the
ravenous beast, probably maddened by hunger and the
instinct of preservation. Don Pablo, lest our prey should
escape us, closed the door from within and we remained in
almost total darkness, since the feeble light which entered
by a narrow slit of a window merely illumined the immediate
obscurity. Gradually, however, our eyes got accustomed
to the murkiness, and we saw that the room was
lumbered with a lot of old and broken furniture; above
our heads floated dense curtains of spider webs covered
with the dust of a century. Then we began to look for the
truant; but saw nothing nor in fact any indication of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
presence. I expressed my doubt to Don Pablo; but he
replied—</p>
<p>“Oh, she’s here. I saw her enter a moment ago.”</p>
<p>We moved some empty cases, threw on one side some
bits of a broken armchair and a little barrel, and then saw
a small body glide away and leap over the piled-up objects.
It was Pussy. We could see in the dark background her
two golden-green eyes, watching the movements of her persecutors
with a fierce inquietude.</p>
<p>“Do you see her?” said the doctor. “Take my gun
and shoot at her.”</p>
<p>“No,” I replied laughing. “It is not very easy to aim
in the dark. The gun is of no good. Keep on one side
and give me your hunting-knife.”</p>
<p>The two eyes remained motionless in their first position,
and that green and golden light, unlike the irradiation of
any other gaze, or any gem, produced in me a strong
impression of terror. I gradually distinguished the outline
of the animal, and the grey and black stripes on her tawny
coat multiplied in my eyes, increasing the size of her body
till she had the proportions of a tiger. I was afraid, why
deny it? and for a moment repented having undertaken
such a difficult task. Don Pablo was more frightened than
I, his teeth were chattering.</p>
<p>We held a council of war, the result of which was that
we were to take the offensive; but when we had recovered
a little valour, we heard a low rumbling, a noise between a
dove’s coo and a death-rattle, which announced Puss
hostile disposition. The cat was saying to us in her
language, “Come on, murderers of my children, I am
ready for you!”</p>
<p>She had first adopted a sphinx-like posture, but now
cowered together, her angular head resting on her fore paws,
and her eyes changed, projecting a blue light in vertical
rays. Her grim aspect seemed to glower at us. Then she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
raised her head, rubbed her paws over her face, cleaning
her long whiskers, and took a few somersaults to descend
to a nearer site, where she crouched in readiness to spring.
The muscular force possessed by these animals in the
articulation of their hind paws is immense, and she could
have sprung upon us in one bound. I saw her looks
were directed more especially towards Don Pablo than
myself.</p>
<p>“Andres,” he said, “if you are afraid, I shall attack her.
I disgraceful that such a little animal should make
cowards like this of two men. Yes, Señora Pussy, we shall
eat you.”</p>
<p>It seemed as if the animal heard and understood the
threatening words, for my friend had scarcely pronounced
them when she precipitated herself with lightning speed
upon him, alighting on his neck and shoulders. The
struggle was short, and the cat had put into execution the
whole of her offensive power, so that the rest of the combat
could not be otherwise than favourable to us. I hastened
to my all defence, and the animal fell to the ground,
carrying away with her claws some particles of the good
doctor’s person and tattooing my right hand. She then
doubled in different directions, but once as she sprang at
me, I had the good luck to receive her on the point of
the hunting-knife, which put an end to the unequal combat.</p>
<p>“The animal was more formidable than I thought,”
said Don Pablo, putting his hand to his beating heart.</p>
<p>“Well, doctor,” said I, after a pause, “let us now divide
the prey.”</p>
<p>The doctor pulled a face of profound disgust, and, wiping
the blood from his neck, said in the most aggressive tone I
had heard from his lips—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>
<p>“Wha that about dividing? Siseta gave me the cat in
exchange for my books. Do you know my daughter ate
nothing yesterday?”</p>
<p>“Siseta and the children have also eaten nothing,” I replied.</p>
<p>Don Pablo scratched his head, making ugly contractions
with his mouth and nostrils—and taking the dead animal by
the neck, said—</p>
<p>“Do bother me, Andres. The children can live on
any rubbish they pick up in the street; but my invalid
needs better food; do me the favour not to touch the cat.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean to say you wo divide the cat? Good,
good,” I said, and advanced towards him. Our hands
met; we struggled for a short time and then the doctor fell
and rolled along the floor, leaving me in full possession of
our prey.</p>
<p>“Thief! thief!” he exclaimed. “Is this the way you
rob me? Just wait a moment!”</p>
<p>I was picking up our victim to leave the loft. But the
doctor ran, or rather leapt like a cat, to the gun, and aimed
it full at me, crying with a hoarse and tremulous voice—</p>
<p>“Drop the cat, or I’ll kill you.”</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>“Don Pablo,” said I, “take the cat. You have become
a wild beast.”</p>
<p>Without reply, but showing the horrible agitation of his
mind by a smothered groan, he seized the animal which I
had hurled from me, and opening the door, disappeared.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">M<span class="smcap">analet</span> ran away, but he soon came back with a
lot of other little boys, all barefoot, dirty, unkempt,
and ragged, and amongst them his brother Badoret, with
Gasparo pickapack, clinging tightly with arms and legs to
his shoulders and waist. All seemed very pleased, especially
Badoret, who was distributing cherries to his companions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>
<p>“Take one, Andres,” said the boy, giving me a cherry.
“How did you think I got them? Well, I’ll tell you. I
was going with Gasparo on my back down the calle del
Lobo, when I saw open the gate of the Convent of the
Capuchin Nuns, which is always shut. Gasparo would
keep on asking me for bread and crying, and I gave him
little slaps to make him keep quiet, telling him that if he
wouldn’t leave off I would tell his Excellency the Governor.
But when I saw the convent gate open, I said to myself,
‘there will be something to find here,’and I slipped in. I
crossed the courtyard, and then entered the church and
passed through the choir till I reached a long corridor with
a lot of little rooms, and I didn’t meet a soul. I looked
carefully everywhere to see if I could get anything, but I
only came across some candle-ends and two or three skeins
of silk, which I began to chew to see if they gave any juice.
I was thinking of returning to the street, when I heard
behind me, ‘<i>Ss—t, Ss—t</i>’, as if somebody was calling me.
I looked, but I saw nobody. Oh, how afraid I was, Andres!
Down at the bottom of the corridor there was a huge print, in
which was a devil with a long green tail. I thought it was
the devil calling me, and began to run. But, oh dear! I
could not find a door, and I went round and round that
horrid corridor, and all the time, ‘<i>Ss—t!</i>’ And then I
heard some one say, ‘Little boy, come here,’and I looked
at the ceiling and the walls, until I at last saw behind some
bars a white hand and a worn and wrinkled face. I was not
afraid then, and went to it. The nun said to me, ‘Come,
don’t be afraid, I have something to say to you.’I went
close to the grating, and said to her, ‘Pardon me, Señora, I
thought you were the devil.’”</p>
<p>“Why, it must have been some poor sick nun who could
not escape with the others.”</p>
<p>“That’s it. The lady said to me, ‘Little boy, how did
you come in here? God has sent you to do me a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
service. All the sisters have gone away. I am ill and a
cripple. They wanted to take me, but it grew late, and so
they left me behind. I am very afraid. Is all the town
burnt? Have the French entered? Just now, when I was
half asleep, I dreamt that all the sisters had been beheaded
in the slaughter-house, and that the French were eating
them. Boy, would you venture to go, now at once, to the
fort, and give this note to my nephew, Don Alonso Carrillo,
captain of the regiment of Ultonia? If you do so, I will
give you the dish of cherries you see here, and this half loaf.’
“Even if she hadn’t offered them me I would have gone,
you know. I seized the note, she told me where I could
get out, and I ran towards the fort. Gasparo cried more
than before, but I said to him, ‘If you don't keep quiet,
I’ll put you in a cannon as if you were a ball, and shoot
you away, and you’ll go rolling amongst the French, who
will cook you in a saucepan and eat you.’
“At last I reached the fort. What a lot of firing there!
That down here is nothing to it. The cannon balls whizzed
through the air like a flight of birds. And do you think I
was afraid? Not I! Gasparo went on crying and screaming;
but I showed him the flames bursting from the bombs,
and the flashes from the powder-pans, and said, ‘Look, how
pretty! We are going to shoot cannons too now!’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
“A soldier gave me a cuff to push me to one side, and I
fell on a heap of dead, but I got up and went straight on.
Then the Governor appeared, and grasping a large black
banner he waved it in the air, and then he said that he would
have the first coward hanged. What do you think of that?
I went in front and shouted, ‘Quite right, too!’ ‘Some
soldiers told me to go away, and the women who were looking
after the wounded began to abuse me, asking me why I
had taken the baby there. What a crowd of sparks! They
fell like flies, first one, then another. The French wanted
to get in, but we wouldn't let them.”</p>
<p>“What? You wouldn't?”</p>
<p>“Yes; the women and our men threw stones from the
top of the wall at the scoundrels who wanted to climb
them. I loosened Gasparo, putting him on the top of a
box in which was some powder and cannon-balls, and I also
began to throw stones. And what stones! I threw one
which weighed at least six hundredweight, and hit a Frenchman,
doubling him in two. You ought to have seen it.
The French were many, and they wanted to do nothing else
but come into the fort. You should have seen the Governor,
Andresillo! Don Mariano, and I, we sprang in front ... and
always went where the soldiers were most hard pressed. I
don’t know what I did, but I did something, Andres. I
could not see for the smoke, nor hear for the noise. Such
terrible firing! Into your very ears, Andres. It makes
one quite deaf. I began to shout, calling them blackguards,
thieves, and telling them that Napoleon was a good-for-nothing.
Maybe they didn’t hear me for the noise, but I
made them turn back and a-half. Rather! Well, Andres,
not to tire you, I stayed there until they retreated. The
Governor told me he was satisfied—no, he did not speak to
me, he said it to the rest.”</p>
<p>“But the letter.”</p>
<p>“I looked for Captain Carrillo—I knew him by sight
before—and I met him at last when all was over. I gave
him the paper, and he gave me a message for the nun.
Then, remembering Gasparo, I went to look for him where
I had left him, but he wasn’t there. I began to shout out,
‘Gasparo, Gasparo!’ but he didn’t answer. At last I saw
him under a gun carriage, rolled up like a little ball, with
his fists in his mouth, looking between the spokes of the
wheel, and a large tear in each eye. I put him on my
back and ran to the convent. But now comes the best of
it; as I was going along thinking of battles, and my head
full of all I had seen, I forgot the message the Captain had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
given me for the nun. She scolded me, saying that I had
torn up the letter, and wanted to deceive her, and that she
couldn’t think of giving me either the cherries or the bread
she had promised. And then she began to grumble, and
called me a bad boy and a beast. One of Gasparo’s toes was
bleeding, and the nun tied a rag round it; but the cherries—not
a single one! At last all was settled, for Captain
Carrillo came himself, and she gave me the cherries and the
bread, and I ran out of the convent.”</p>
<p>“Take the child home to your sister,” I said, noticing
that poor Gaspar foot was still bleeding.</p>
<p>“I have kept some cherries for Siseta,” he cried.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>“Oh, I say, boys!” shouted Manalet, running back
towards us, “the Governor is going through the town
with a lot of people and banners; the ladies are singing in
front, and the monks dancing, and the bishop smiling, and
the nuns crying. Come along!”</p>
<p>And like a flock of birds the band of children ran down
the street.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FIRST_LOVE"> <i>FIRST LOVE.</i></h2>
</div>
<p>How old I was then? Eleven or twelve years?
More probably thirteen, for before then is too early
to be seriously in love; but I won’t venture to be certain,
considering that in Southern countries the heart matures
early, if that organ is to blame for such perturbations.</p>
<p>If I do not remember well <i>when</i>, I can at least say
exactly <i>how</i> my love first revealed itself. I was very fond—as
soon as my aunt had gone to church to perform her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
evening devotions—of slipping into her bedroom and
rummaging her chest of drawers, which she kept in admirable
order. Those drawers were to me a museum; in
them I always came across something rare or antique, which
exhaled an archaic and mysterious scent, the aroma of the
sandalwood fans which perfumed her white linen. Pincushions
of satin now faded; knitted mittens, carefully
wrapped in tissue paper; prints of saints; sewing materials;
a reticule of blue velvet embroidered with bugles, an amber
and silver rosary would appear from the corners: I used to
ponder over them, and return them to their place. But one
day—I remember as well as if it were to-day—in the corner
of the top drawer, and lying on some collars of old lace,
I saw something gold glittering.... I put in my hand, unwittingly
crumpled the lace, and drew out a portrait, an
ivory miniature, about three inches long, in a frame of gold.</p>
<p>I was struck at first sight. A sunbeam streamed through
the window and fell upon the alluring form, which seemed
to wish to step out of its dark background and come
towards me. It was a most lovely creature, such as I had
never seen except in the dreams of my adolescence. The
lady of the portrait must have been some twenty-odd years;
she was no simple maiden, no half-opened rosebud, but
a woman in the full resplendency of her beauty. Her face
was oval, but not too long, her lips full, half-open and
smiling, her eyes cast a languishing side-glance, and she had
a dimple on her chin as if formed by the tip of Cupid’s
playful finger. Her head-dress was strange but elegant;
a compact group of curls plastered conewise one over the
other covered her temples, and a basket of braided hair
rose on the top of her head. This old-fashioned head-dress,
which was trussed up from the nape of her neck, disclosed
all the softness of her fresh young throat, on which the
dimple of her chin was reduplicated more vaguely and
delicately. As for the dress ... I do not venture to consider<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
whether our grandmothers were less modest than our
wives are, or if the confessors of past times were more
indulgent than those of the present; I am inclined to think
the latter, for seventy years ago women prided themselves
upon being Christianlike and devout, and would not have
disobeyed the director of their conscience in so grave and
important a matter. What is undeniable is, that if in the
present day any lady were to present herself in the garb
of the lady of the portrait, there would be a scandal; for
from her waist (which began at her armpits) upwards, she
was only veiled by light folds of diaphanous gauze, which
marked out, rather than covered, two mountains of snow,
between which meandered a thread of pearls. With further
lack of modesty she stretched out two rounded arms worthy
of Juno, ending in finely-moulded hands ... when I say
<i>hands</i> I am not exact, for, strictly speaking, only one hand
could be seen, and that held a richly embroidered handkerchief.</p>
<p>Even to-day I am astonished at the startling effect which
the contemplation of that miniature produced upon me,
and how I remained in ecstasy, scarcely breathing, devouring
the portrait with my eyes. I had already seen here and
there prints representing beautiful women: it often happened
that in the illustrated papers, in the mythological engravings
of our dining-room, or in a shop-window, that a beautiful
face, or a harmonious and graceful figure attracted my precociously
artistic gaze; but the miniature encountered in
my aunt’s drawer, apart from its great beauty, appeared to
me as if animated by a subtle and vital breath; you could
see it was not the caprice of a painter, but the image of a
real and actual person of flesh and blood. The warm and
rich tone of the tints made you surmise that the blood was
tepid beneath that mother-of-pearl skin. The lips were
slightly parted to disclose the enamelled teeth; and to
complete the illusion there ran round the frame a border of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
natural hair, chestnut in colour, wavy and silky, which had
grown on the temples of the original. As I have said, it
was more than a copy, it was the reflection of a living
person from whom I was only separated by a wall of glass....
I seized it, breathed upon it, and it seemed to me
that the warmth of the mysterious deity communicated
itself to my lips and circulated through my veins. At this
moment I heard footsteps in the corridor. It was my aunt
returning from her prayers. I heard her asthmatic cough,
and the dragging of her gouty feet. I had only just time to
put the miniature into the drawer, shut it, and approach the
window, adopting an innocent and indifferent attitude.</p>
<p>My aunt entered noisily, for the cold of the church had
exasperated her catarrh, now chronic. Upon seeing me, her
wrinkled little eyes brightened, and giving me a friendly tap
with her withered hand, she asked me if I had been turning
over her drawers as usual.</p>
<p>Then, with a chuckle—</p>
<p>“Wait a bit, wait a bit,” she added, “I have something
for you, something you will like.”</p>
<p>And she pulled out of her vast pocket a paper bag, and
out of the bag three or four gum lozenges, sticking together
in a cake, which gave me a feeling of nausea.</p>
<p>My aunt’s appearance did not invite one to open one’s
mouth and devour these sweets: the course of years, her
loss of teeth, her eyes dimmed to an unusual degree, the
sprouting of a moustache or bristles on her sunken-in
mouth, which was three inches wide, dull grey locks fluttering
above her sallow temples, a neck flaccid and livid as the
crest of the turkey when in a good temper.... In short,
I did not take the lozenges. Ugh! A feeling of indignation,
a manly protest rose in me, and I said forcibly—</p>
<p>“I do not want it, I don’t want it.”</p>
<p>“You don’t want it? What a wonder! You who are
greedier than a cat!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>
<p>“I am not a little boy,” I exclaimed, drawing myself up,
and standing on tip-toes; “I don’t care for sweets.”</p>
<p>My aunt looked at me half good-humouredly and half
ironically, and at last, giving way to the feeling of amusement
I caused her, burst out laughing, by which she disfigured
herself, and exposed the horrible anatomy of her jaws.
She laughed so heartily that her chin and nose met, hiding
her lips, and emphasising two wrinkles, or rather two deep
furrows, and more than a dozen lines on her cheeks and
eyelids; at the same time her head and body shook with
the laughter, until at last her cough began to interrupt the
bursts, and between laughing and coughing the old lady
involuntarily spluttered all over my face.... Humiliated,
and full of disgust, I escaped rapidly thence to my mother’s
room, where I washed myself with soap and water, and
began to muse on the lady of the portrait.</p>
<p>And from that day and hour I could not keep my
thoughts from her. As soon as my aunt went out, to slip
into her room, open the drawer, bring out the miniature, and
lose myself in contemplation, was the work of a minute.
By dint of looking at it, I fancied that her languishing eyes,
through the voluptuous veiling of her eyelashes, were fixed
in mine, and that her white bosom heaved. I became
ashamed to kiss her, imagining she would be annoyed at
my audacity, and only pressed her to my heart or held her
against my cheek. All my actions and thoughts referred to
the lady; I behaved towards her with the most extraordinary
refinement and super-delicacy. Before entering my aunt’s
room and opening the longed-for drawer, I washed, combed
my hair, and tidied myself, as I have seen since is usually
done before repairing to a love appointment. I often
happened to meet in the street other boys of my age, very
proud of their slip of a sweetheart, who would exultingly
show me love-letters, photographs, and flowers, and who
asked me if I hadn’t a sweetheart with whom to correspond.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
A feeling of inexplicable bashfulness tied my tongue, and
I only replied with an enigmatic and haughty smile. And
when they questioned me as to what I thought of the beauty
of their little maidens, I would shrug my shoulders and
disdainfully call them <i>ugly mugs</i>. One Sunday I went to
play in the house of some little girl-cousins, really very
pretty, and the elder of whom was not yet fifteen.</p>
<p>We were amusing ourselves looking into a stereoscope,
when suddenly one of the little girls, the youngest, who
counted twelve summers at most, secretly seized my hand,
and in some confusion and blushing as red as a brazier,
whispered in my ear—</p>
<p>“Take this.”</p>
<p>At the same time I felt in the palm of my hand some
thing soft and fresh, and saw that it was a rosebud with its
green foliage. The little girl ran away smiling and casting
a side-glance at me; but I, with a Puritanism worthy of
Joseph, cried out in my turn—</p>
<p>“Take this!”</p>
<p>And I threw the rosebud at her nose, a rebuff which made
her tearful and pettish with me the whole afternoon, and
which she has not pardoned me even now, though she is
married and has three children.</p>
<p>The two or three hours which my aunt spent morning
and evening together at church being too short for my
admiration of the entrancing portrait, I resolved at last to
keep the miniature in my pocket, and went about all day
hiding myself from people just as if I had committed a
crime. I fancied that the portrait from the depth of its
prison of cloth could see all my actions, and I arrived at
such a ridiculous extremity, that if I wanted to scratch
myself, pull up my sock, or do anything else not in keeping
with the idealism of my chaste love, I first drew out the
miniature, put it in a safe place, and then considered myself
free to do whatever I wanted. In fact, since I had accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
the theft, there was no limit to my vagaries; at night
I hid it under the pillow, and slept in an attitude of defence;
the portrait remained near the wall, I outside, and I awoke
a thousand times, fearing somebody would come to bereave
me of my treasure. At last I drew it from beneath the
pillow and slipped it between my nightshirt and left breast,
on which the following day could be seen the imprint of the
chasing of the frame.</p>
<p>The contact of the dear miniature gave me delicious
dreams. The lady of the portrait, not in effigy, but in her
natural size and proportions, alive, graceful, affable, beautiful,
would come towards me to conduct me to her palace by
a rapid and flying train. With sweet authority she would
make me sit on a stool at her feet, and would pass her
beautifully moulded hand over my head, caressing my brow,
my eyes, and loose curls. I read to her out of a big missal,
or played the lute, and she deigned to smile, thanking me
for the pleasure which my reading and songs gave her. At
last romantic reminiscences overflowed in my brain, and
sometimes I was a page, and sometimes a troubadour.</p>
<p>With all these fanciful ideas, the fact is, that I began to
grow thin quite perceptibly, which was observed with great
disquietude by my parents and my aunt.</p>
<p>“In this dangerous and critical age of development,
everything is alarming,” said my father, who used to read
books of medicine, and anxiously studied my dark eyelids,
my dull eyes, my contracted and pale lips, and above all, the
complete lack of appetite which had taken possession of me.</p>
<p>“Play, boy; eat, boy,” he would say to me, and I replied
to him dejectedly—</p>
<p>“I don’t feel inclined.”</p>
<p>They began to talk of distractions, offered to take me to
the theatre; stopped my studies, and gave me foaming new
milk to drink. Afterwards they poured cold water over my
head and back to fortify my nerves; and I noticed that my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
father at table or in the morning when I went to his bedroom
to bid him good morning, would gaze at me fixedly
for some little time, and would sometimes pass his hand
down my spine, feeling the vertebræ. I hypocritically
lowered my eyes, resolved to die rather than confess my
crime. As soon as I was free from the affectionate solicitude
of my family, I found myself alone with my lady of the
portrait. At last, to get nearer to her, I thought I would
do away with the cold crystal. I trembled upon putting
this into execution; but at last my love prevailed over the
vague fear with which such a profanation filled me, and
with skilful cunning I succeeded in pulling away the glass
and exposing the ivory plate. As I pressed my lips to the
painting and could scent the slight fragrance of the border
of hair, I imagined to myself even more realistically that it
was a living person whom I was grasping with my
trembling hands. A feeling of faintness overpowered me,
and I fell unconscious on the sofa, tightly holding the
miniature.</p>
<p>When I came to my senses I saw my father, my mother,
and my aunt, all bending anxiously over me; I read their
terror and alarm in their faces: my father was feeling my
pulse, shaking his head, and murmuring—</p>
<p>“His pulse is nothing but a flutter, you can scarcely feel
it.”</p>
<p>My aunt, with her claw-like fingers was trying to take the
portrait from me, and I was mechanically hiding it and
grasping it more firmly.</p>
<p>“But, my dear boy.... Let go, you are spoiling it!”
she exclaimed. “Do you see you are smudging it? I
am not scolding you, my dear.... I will show it to you
as often as you like, but don’t destroy it; let go, you are
injuring it.”</p>
<p>“Let him have it,” begged my mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span> “the boy is not
well.”</p>
<p>“Of all things to ask!” replied the old maid. “Let
him have it! And who will paint another like this ... or
make me as I was then? To-day nobody paints miniatures
... it is a thing of the past, and I also am a thing
of the past, and I am not what is represented there!”</p>
<p>My eyes dilated with horror; my fingers released their
hold on the picture. I don’t know how I was able to
articulate—</p>
<p>“You ... the portrait ... is you...?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think I am as pretty now, boy? Bah! one
is better looking at twenty-three than at ... than at ...
I don’t know what, for I have forgotten how old I am!”</p>
<p>My head drooped and I almost fainted again; anyway,
my father lifted me in his arms on to the bed, and made
me swallow some tablespoons of port.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>I recovered very quickly, and never wished to enter
my aunt’s room again.</p>

<p class="center">A RURAL TALE.</p>
<p>Gaffer Buscabeatas was already beginning to
stoop at the time when the events occurred which I
am going to relate; for he was now sixty years old, and of
these sixty years he had spent forty cultivating a garden
bordering on the shore of La Costilla.</p>
<p>In the year in question he had cultivated in this garden
some wonderful pumpkins, as large as the ornamental globes
on the breastwork of some massive bridge, that at the time
of our story were beginning to turn yellow, inside and out,
which is the same as saying that it was the middle of June.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
Old Buscabeatas knew by heart the particular form and
the stage of maturity at which it had arrived of every one
of these pumpkins, to each of which he had given a name,
and especially of the forty largest and finest specimens,
which were already crying out, “Cook me!” and he spent
the days contemplating them affectionately, and saying in
melancholy accents—</p>
<p>“Soon we shall have to part!”</p>
<p>At last, one evening, he made up his mind to the sacrifice,
and marking out the best fruits of those beloved vines
which had cost him so many anxieties, he pronounced the
dreadful sentence—</p>
<p>“To-morrow,” he said, “I shall cut from their stalks
these forty pumpkins and take them to the market at Cadiz.
Happy the man who shall eat of them!”</p>
<p>And he returned to his home with slow step and spent
the night in such anguish as a father may be supposed to
feel on the eve of his daughter’s wedding-day.</p>
<p>“What a pity to have to part from my dear pumpkins!”
he would sigh from time to time in his restless vigil. But
presently he would reason with himself and end his reflections
by saying, “And what else can I do but sell them?
That is what I have raised them for. The least they will
bring me is fifteen dollars!”</p>
<p>Judge, then, what was his consternation, what his rage
and despair, on going into the garden on the following
morning, to find that during the night he had been robbed
of his forty pumpkins! Not to weary the reader, I will
only say that his emotion, like that of Shakespeare’s Jew,
so admirably represented, it is said, by the actor Kemble,
reached the sublimity of tragedy as he frantically cried—</p>
<p>“Oh, if I could but find the thief! If I could but find
the thief!”</p>
<p>Poor old Buscabeatas presently began to reflect upon the
matter with calmness, and comprehended that his beloved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
treasures could not be in Rota, where it would be impossible
to expose them for sale without risk of their being
recognised, and where, besides, vegetables bring a very
low price.</p>
<p>“I know as well as if I saw them, that they are in
Cadiz!” he ended. “The scoundrel! the villain! the
thief must have stolen them between nine and ten o’clock
last night, and got off with them at midnight on the freight-boat.
I shall go to Cadiz this morning on the hour-boat,
and it will surprise me greatly if I do not catch the thief
there, and recover the children of my toil.”</p>
<p>After he had thus spoken, he remained for some twenty
minutes longer on the scene of the catastrophe, whether to
caress the mutilated vines, to calculate the number of
pumpkins that were missing, or to formulate a declaration
of the loss sustained, for a possible suit; then, at about
eight o’clock, he bent his steps in the direction of the
wharf.</p>
<p>The hour-boat was just going to sail. This was a modest
coaster which leaves Cadiz every morning at nine lock
precisely, carrying passengers, as the freight-boat leaves
Cadiz every night at twelve, laden with fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>The former is called the hour-boat because in that
space of time, and occasionally even in forty minutes, if
the wind is favourable, it makes the three leagues which
separate the ancient village of the Duke of Arcos from the
ancient city of Hercules.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>It was, then, half-past ten in the morning on the before-mentioned
day, when old Buscabeatas passed before a
vegetable-stand in the market of Cadiz, and said to the
bored policeman who was accompanying him—</p>
<p>“Those are my squashes! arrest that man!” and he
pointed to the vendor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>
<p>“Arrest me!” cried the vendor, astonished and enraged.
“These squashes are mine; I bought them!”</p>
<p>“You will have to prove that before the judge!”
answered old Buscabeatas.</p>
<p>“I say No!”</p>
<p>“I say Yes!”</p>
<p>“Thief!”</p>
<p>“Vagabond!”</p>
<p>“Speak more civilly, you ill-mannered fellows! Decent
men ought not to treat one another in that way!” said the
policeman tranquilly, giving a blow with his closed fist to
each of the disputants.</p>
<p>By this time a crowd had gathered, and there soon
arrived also on the scene the inspector of public markets.</p>
<p>The policeman resigned his jurisdiction in the case to
his Honour, and when this worthy official had learned all
the circumstances relating to the affair, he said to the
vendor majestically—</p>
<p>“From whom did you purchase those squashes?”</p>
<p>“From Gossip Fulano, a native of Rota,” answered the
person thus interrogated.</p>
<p>“It could be no one else!” cried old Buscabeatas.
“He is just the one to do it! When his own garden,
which is a very poor one, produces little, he takes to robbing
the gardens of his neighbours!”</p>
<p>“But, admitting the supposition that forty pumpkins were
stolen from you last night,” said the inspector, turning to
the old gardener and proceeding with his examination,
“how do you know that these are precisely your pumpkins?”</p>
<p>“How?” replied old Buscabeatas.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span> “Because I know
them as well as you know your daughters, if you have any!
Don’t you see that they have grown up under my care?
Look here: this one is called Roly-poly, this one Fat-cheeks,
this one Big-belly, this one Ruddy-face, this
Manuela, because it reminded me of my youngest
daughter.”</p>
<p>And the poor old man began to cry bitterly.</p>
<p>“That may be all very well,” replied the inspector;
“but it is not enough for the law that you should recognise
your pumpkins. It is necessary also that the authorities be
convinced of the pre-existence of the article in dispute, and
that you identify it with incontrovertible proofs; gentlemen,
there is no occasion for you to smile—I know the
law!”</p>
<p>“You shall see, then, that I will very soon prove to the
satisfaction of everybody present, without stirring from this
spot, that these pumpkins have grown in my garden!” said
old Buscabeatas, to the no little surprise of the spectators
of this scene. And laying down on the ground a
bundle which he had been carrying in his hand, he bent
his knees until he sat upon his heels, and quietly began to
untie the knotted corners of the handkerchief.</p>
<p>The curiosity of the inspector, the vendor, and the chorus
was now at its height.</p>
<p>“What is he going to take out of that handkerchief?”
they said to themselves.</p>
<p>At this moment a new spectator joined the crowd,
curious to see what was going on, whom the vendor had
no sooner perceived than he exclaimed—</p>
<p>“I am very glad that you have come, Gossip Fulano!
This man declares that the squashes which you sold me
last night, and which are now here present, listening to
what we are saying about them, were stolen. Answer,
you!”</p>
<p>The newcomer turned as yellow as wax, and made a
movement as if to escape, but the bystanders detained him
by force, and the inspector himself ordered him to remain.
As for Gaffer Buscabeatas, he had already confronted the
supposed thief, saying to him—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>
<p>“Now you are going to see something good.”</p>
<p>Gossip Fulano, recovering his self-possession, answered—</p>
<p>“It is you who ought to see what you are talking about,
for if you do not prove, as prove you cannot, your accusation,
I shall have you put in prison for libel. These
pumpkins were mine. I cultivated them, like all the others
that I brought this year to Cadiz, in my garden, the Egido,
and no one can prove to the contrary!”</p>
<p>“Now you shall see!” repeated old Buscabeatas,
loosening the knots of the handkerchief and spreading out
its contents on the ground.</p>
<p>And there were scattered over the floor a number of
fragments of pumpkin stalks, still fresh and dripping sap,
while the old gardener, seated on his heels and unable to
control his laughter, addressed the following discourse to
the inspector and the wondering bystanders.</p>
<p>“Gentlemen, have any of you ever paid taxes? If you
have, you must have seen the big green book of the collector,
from which he tears off your receipt, leaving the stub
or end, so as to be able to prove afterward whether the
receipt is genuine or not.”</p>
<p>“The book you mean is called the account-book,” said
the inspector gravely.</p>
<p>“Well, that is what I have here—the account-book of
my garden; that is to say, the stalks to which these
pumpkins were attached before they were stolen from me.
And in proof of what I say, look here! This stalk belongs
to this pumpkin; no one can doubt it. This other—you
can see for yourselves—belonged to this other. This is
thicker—it must belong to this one. This to that one.
This to that other.”</p>
<p>And as he spoke he went fitting a stub or peduncle to
the hole which had been made in each pumpkin as it was
pulled from the stalk, and the spectators saw with surprise
that the irregular and capricious shaped ends of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
peduncles corresponded exactly with the whitish circles and
the slight hollows presented by what we might call the
cicatrices of the pumpkins.</p>
<p>Every one present, including the policeman, and even
the inspector himself, then got down on their heels and
began to help old Buscabeatas in his singular comprobation,
crying out with childlike delight—</p>
<p>“He is right! he is right! There is not a doubt of it!
Look! This belongs to this one. This to that one.
That one there belongs to this. This belongs to that!”
And the bursts of laughter of the grown people were
mingled with the whistling of the boys, the abuse of the
women, the tears of joy and triumph of the old gardener,
and the pushes that the policeman gave to the convicted
thief, as if they were impatient to carry him off to
prison.</p>
<p>Needless to say that the policeman had that pleasure;
that Gossip Fulano was immediately compelled to restore to
the vendor the fifteen dollars he had received from him,
that the vendor handed these over at once to Gaffer Buscabeatas,
and that the latter departed for Rota, highly
delighted, although he kept repeating all the way home—</p>
<p>“How handsome they looked in the market! I should
have brought Manuela back with me to eat at supper to-night,
and save the seeds.”</p>

<p>Along a gentle slope, over which was intended to be
a high-road, we descended to the spring which gushes
out in the very middle of the river Guadalquivir, which
comes circling around the brow of the sierra. There is a
gallery or bridge which leads from the shore to the spring.
Across it were gravely walking two or three persons, who,
by their wandering and vacant looks, showed that they were
perhaps paying more attention to the contents of their
stomachs than to the discourse and steps of their companions.
From time to time they hastened to the spring,
descended the steps, asked for a glass of water, and drank
it eagerly, shutting their eyes with a kind of pleasurable
emotion, suggesting the hope of health.</p>
<p>“Have you been taking much of the water, Mother?”
asked my landlord, leaning over the railing of the well.</p>
<p>A short, plump nun, who appeared to be dropsical, and
had a small red nose, raised her head just as she was about
to put the glass to her lips.</p>
<p>“Good morning, Señor Paco.... I have had only four
glasses so far. Would you like a little to increase your
appetite?”</p>
<p>That greatly delighted my landlord.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>
<p>“Increase my appetite, eh? Give me something to
reduce it, rather! that’s what I should prefer.... And
the Sisters?”</p>
<p>Two young nuns, not at all ill-favoured, who were
standing beside the other with their heads raised towards
us, smiled politely.</p>
<p>“The same as always; two little sips,” rejoined one of
them, who had lively black eyes, and spoke with a downright
Andalusian accent, and displayed an elegant set of
teeth.</p>
<p>“How little!”</p>
<p>“Why, surely you would not wish to make our stomachs
ponds for anchovies, would you, like the Mother’s?”</p>
<p>“Anchovies?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Cadiz anchovies. You have only to cast the net.”</p>
<p>The Mother’s dropsical form was shaken violently by a
laughing fit. The anchovies swimming in her stomach,
according to the young nun, must have thought that they
were exposed to an earthquake.</p>
<p>We all laughed and went down to the spring. As we
came near the Mother, she greeted me with an affectionate
smile. I bent low, took the crucifix which hung from her
girdle, and kissed it. The nun smiled still more tenderly,
and looked at me with an expression of generous sympathy.</p>
<p>Let us be explicit: if this book is to be an honest history
or confession of my life, it is my duty to declare that by
the act of bending over to kiss the metal crucifix, I do not
think that I was actuated by any mystic impulse, rather, I
suspect, that the pretty Sister’s black eyes shrewdly fixed
upon me had a very active part in it. Perhaps, without
being aware of it, I desired to ingratiate myself with those
eyes. And the truth is that I failed in my attempt; because,
instead of showing that she was flattered by such an
act of devotion, it seemed to me that they assumed a slight
expression of mockery. I was a bit confused.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>
<p>“Has the gentleman come to take the waters?” asked
the Mother half directly, half indirectly.</p>
<p>“Yes, señora, I have just arrived from Madrid.”</p>
<p>“They are wonderful! The Lord our God has given
them a virtue which is almost beyond belief. You will
see how they develop the appetite. You will eat as much
as you possibly can, and it will not hurt you.... You
see, I can say I am a different woman, and it is only a
week since we came.... Just imagine! yesterday I ate
pig’s liver, and it did not hurt me at all.... Then this
young girl,” she added, pointing to the black-eyed Sister:
“I can’t tell you what a colour she had! She was as pale
as ashes. To be sure she hasn’t much colour yet, but, ...
there now, ... that is another thing.”</p>
<p>I looked at her closely, and noticed that she was
blushing, though she instantly turned her back to get
another glass of water.</p>
<p>She was a young woman of nineteen or twenty, of
average height, with an oval face of a pale brunette, her
nose slightly “tip-tilted,” her teeth white and close, and her
eyes, as I have already said, of an intense and velvety black,
shaded by long lashes, and bordered by a slight pink circle.
Her hair was entirely covered from sight by the hood that
bound her forehead. She was dressed in black serge, with
a girdle around her waist, from which hung a large bronze
crucifix. On her head, beside the hood, she wore a great
white <i>papalina</i>, or “coronet,” with stiffly starched flaps.
Her shoes were large and coarse, but could not wholly disguise
the grace of her dainty Southern foot.</p>
<p>The other Sister was likewise young, perhaps even
younger than the first, as well as shorter in stature, and
with a lily-white face, showing under the transparent skin
an exceedingly lymphatic temperament; her eyes were
clear blue, her teeth somewhat faulty. By the purity and
correctness of her features, and likewise by her quiet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
manners, she looked like a Virgin of painted wood. She
kept her eyes constantly fixed upon the ground, and did
not open her lips during the short moments that we were
together there.</p>
<p>“Come, drink, señor, prove the Divine grace,” said the
Mother.</p>
<p>I took the glass which the Sister with the white teeth had
just laid down, and proceeded to fill it with water, since the
attendant had disappeared through a trap-door; but in
doing so I had to lean on the rock, and when I bent over
to dip the glass into the pool I slipped, and my foot went
in above my ankle.</p>
<p>“Be careful!” simultaneously cried my landlord and the
Mother, as is always said after one has met with any accident.</p>
<p>I drew out my foot with the water spurting from my shoe,
and could not refrain from a rather energetic exclamation.</p>
<p>The Mother was disturbed, and hastened to ask me with
a grave face—</p>
<p>“Did it hurt you?”</p>
<p>The little Sister of the transparent skin blushed up to
her ears. The other began to laugh so heartily, that I gave
her a quick and not very affectionate look. But she paid
no heed to it; she continued to laugh, although, in order
not to meet my eyes, she turned her face the other way.</p>
<p>“Sister San Sulpicio, remember that it is a sin to laugh
at another’s misfortunes,” said the Mother. “Why do you
not imitate Sister Maria de la Luz?”</p>
<p>The latter was blushing like a poppy.</p>
<p>“I can’t help it, Mother, I cannot; excuse me,” she
replied, endeavouring, but without success, to contain herself.</p>
<p>“Let her laugh; the truth is, the thing is more ludicrous
than serious,” said I, affecting good-humour though
angry at heart.</p>
<p>These words, instead of inciting the Sister, had the
opposite effect, and she quickly grew calm. I looked at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
her now and then, with a curiosity mingled with annoyance.
She returned my look with a frank and smiling eye, in
which still lurked a trace of mockery.</p>
<p>“You must change your shoes and stockings as quick
as you can; getting the feet wet is very bad,” said the
Mother with interest.</p>
<p>“Pshaw! I shall not change them till night. I am
accustomed to go all day with my feet soaking,” said I, in
a scornful tone of voice, putting on a show of robustness,
which, unfortunately, I am very far from being blessed with.
But it pleased me to affect bravado before the smiling nun.</p>
<p>“By all means ... go, go home and take off your stocking.
We are going to walk across the gallery to see if the
water is going down. May the Lord our God bless you!”</p>
<p>I once more made a low bow and kissed the Mother’s
crucifix. I did the same with Sister Maria’s, who, of
course, blushed again. As to Sister San Sulpicio’s I refrained
from touching it. I merely bowed low with a grave
face. Thus should she learn not to laugh at people
when they get wet.</p>
<p class="center">II. <span class="allsmcap">IN SEVILLE.</span></p>
<p>... When I returned to my boarding-house to dinner,
I found Paca waiting at the door to give me a letter. I did
not care to open it before the messenger, and tried to
dismiss her as soon as possible. But the worthy woman
was too happy over her señorita’s escape from the convent,
not to chatter for a while. Both interested and impatient, I
was treated to all the particulars; how Doña Tula had gone
to get Gloria in her carriage; how abominably they had
behaved towards her at the convent, no one except the
chaplain coming to bid her good-bye; how happy her
señorita felt to take off her nun’s dress; how glad every
one was to see her “so bright and chipper!” and all the
insignificant words which they had exchanged in their talk.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>
<p>At last she went away, and I hastened to my room,
nervously lighted my candle, and opened the note.</p>
<p>“I am out of the convent,” it read. “If you wish to
receive the promised scolding, pass in front of my house at
eleven o’clock. I will be at the grating, and we will have
a talk.”</p>
<p>The keen joy produced in me by that letter may be
imagined. All my dreams were coming true at once.
Gloria loved me, and was giving me a rendezvous, and this
rendezvous was singularly attractive to a poet and a man of
the North by being at the grating!</p>
<p>The grating—<i>la reja</i>!<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_15" id="FNanchor_15">[15]</a> Does not this word exert a strange
fascination? does it not awake in fancy a swarm of vague,
sweet thoughts, as though it were the symbol and centre of
love and poesy? Who is there with so little imagination
as never to have dreamed of a talk with a loved one
through the grating on a moonlight night? These talks
and these nights have, moreover, the incalculable advantage
that they can be described without an actual experience
of them. There is not a lyrical mosquito among all those
that hum and buzz in the central or septentrional provinces
of Spain who has not given expression to his feelings concerning
them, and framed a more or less harmonious structure
with the sweet notes of the guitar, the scents of tube-roses,
the moonlight scattering its delicate filaments of
silver over the windows, the heavens bespangled with stars,
the orange flowers, the maiden’s fascinating eyes, her warm
perfumed breath, &amp;c.</p>
<p>I myself, as a descriptive poet and colourist, have on more
than one occasion, to the applause of my friends, jumbled
together these commonplaces of Andalusian æsthetics.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>
<p>But now the reality far exceeded and differed from this
poetic conventionalism. For the time being, as I entered
the Calle de Argote de Molina, at eleven o’clock, I failed
to notice whether moon and stars were shining in the sky or
not. It is quite possible that they were, for such things
are natural; but I did not notice. What could be seen
with perfect distinctness was the watchman with pike and
lantern leaning up against a door not very far from Gloria’s.</p>
<p>“Shall I have to wait till this fellow goes off?” I asked
myself with a sudden pang of fear.</p>
<p>Fortunately, after a little while I saw him start away
from that place and move up the street.</p>
<p>Moreover, I went to the trysting-place without guitar or
cloak, merely with a jonquil in my hand, and wearing a
plain and inoffensive jacket. Neither did I go mounted on
a fiery steed, black, dappled, or sorrel; but on my own
wretched legs, which certainly trembled all too violently as
I approached the windows of the house. In one of them
I saw the gleam of a white object, and I hastened to tap
on the grating.</p>
<p>“Gloria!” I said in a very low voice.</p>
<p>“Here I am,” replied the girl’s voice.</p>
<p>At the same instant her graceful bare head bent over
toward the grating, and I saw the gleam of her little white
teeth with that same bewitching and mocking smile which
was so delineated on my heart. I saw her dark velvety
eyes shining. As though I were in the presence of a
supernatural apparition, I stood motionless with both hands
clenching the grating. I found nothing more to say than—</p>
<p>“Còmo sigue V.” “How do you do?”</p>
<p>That ordinary formula of every-day courtesy did not
seem to arouse any sad ideas in her, for I saw her put her
hand to her mouth to hide a laugh. After a brief silence,
she replied—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>
<p>“Well; and you?”</p>
<p>“How I have longed for this moment to arrive!” I exclaimed,
realising that I was not “in situation,” as they say
in the theatres. “Can you not imagine the eagerness with
which I have been waiting for it, Gloria?...”</p>
<p>“And why should you have been anxious for it?”</p>
<p>“Because my heart was tormented with the desire to tell
you how I worship you.”</p>
<p>“That indeed is news! Why, my son, you have repeated
it in the nine letters you have written me, forty-one times....
I counted them!”</p>
<p>“Then it was so as to tell you so the forty-second time.
What is taking place between us, Gloria, seems to me just
like a novel. It is not three months that I have known
you, and yet it seems to me as if I had lived three years
since then. What a change! How it has altered our lives!
You were a nun, and now I see you transformed into a
perfect young lady of the world.”</p>
<p>“So you really find that I am perfect?”</p>
<p>“Exquisite!”</p>
<p>“A thousand thanks. What would it be if you were to
see me!”</p>
<p>“I do see you ... not very well, but sufficient to make
me realise what a favourable change.”</p>
<p>Up to a certain point that was true. Although the
darkness that prevailed in that corner did not allow me to
make out her features, I could see the outline of her graceful
head, adorned with waving hair, and when she bent it over
a little toward the grating, the dim light of the street shone
into her face, which seemed to me paler than when she was
at Marmolejo, though not less lovely.</p>
<p>A moment of silence ensued, and, embarrassed by it, I
said at last—</p>
<p>“Is this your chamber?”</p>
<p>“This is not a chamber, it is the reception-room.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>
<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>And again silence fell.</p>
<p>I noticed that her eyes were fastened upon me, and, if
the truth be told, I could not deceive myself into thinking
that they were overflowing with love, but rather that they
displayed a mischievous curiosity.</p>
<p>“O Gloria, if you only knew how sadly those days
passed for me when I got no word from you! I believed
that you had forgotten me.”</p>
<p>“I never forget my good friends. Besides, I had promised
you one thing, and I should certainly not wish to fail
of fulfilling my promise.”</p>
<p>“What was it?”</p>
<p>“Do you remember?—the scolding....”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes,” I exclaimed, laughing.</p>
<p>And, encouraged by these words, I felt that I ought to
have my love affairs put upon a definite basis, and I said—</p>
<p>“Well, then, Gloria, I have come for nothing else than
to have you undeceive me if I am under a false impression,
or else confirm my hopes of being loved if they have any
foundation. Since I have already repeated forty-one times
that I adore you, as you say, I need not say it again. Ever
since I have seen you and talked with you at Marmolejo,
you have kept me a willing prisoner of love and admiration.
My fate is in your hands, and I wait with the greatest
anxiety to hear my sentence.”</p>
<p>Gloria paused a few moments before she answered; then
she coughed a little, and finally said—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>
<p>“The fatal moment has arrived. Prepare for the worst....
Señor Don Ceferino, I should not tell the truth if I
gave you to understand that from the first day I talked with
you at Marmolejo, I did not perceive that you were courting
me. Further, I believe that the kiss which you gave
Mother Florentina’s crucifix, the first time we saw each
other, you gave me in my honour.... You laugh? Well,
it shows that I was not deceived. Those gallantries of
yours have caused me some annoyances, but I cherish no
hard feelings against you. Sooner or later I had to let the
thunder burst, for I had made up my mind not to stay in
the convent, even though I had to go out to service. Then
you greatly aided me in accomplishing my wishes, and for
this I am very grateful.... But gratitude is one thing and
love is another. So far I have not been able to reciprocate
your love. I esteem you ... I like you, and I shall
never forget how kind you have been to me; but I speak
frankly, I cannot have you live longer labouring under a
mistake. I will be your sincere and affectionate friend....
Your betrothed I cannot be.”</p>
<p>It is absolutely impossible for me to give any idea of my
state of mind on hearing those words. They were spoken
in an ironical tone, which might have left one open to
think that they were in jest, but the reasoning was so
natural and logical that they put an end to any such supposition.
Nevertheless, by a supreme act of self-control, I
burst into a laugh, exclaiming—</p>
<p>“Well, that is a well-fabricated refusal! I might think
that you really meant it!”</p>
<p>“What! don’t you believe what I say?... Child, have
you not a very lofty opinion of your little self?”</p>
<p>“It is not a question of whether I have a high opinion
of myself, Gloria,” I replied, becoming grave; “it is that it
is hard to believe that you would have waited so long to
refuse me.”</p>
<p>“But you have not given me a chance till now!”</p>
<p>“Are you speaking seriously, Gloria?”</p>
<p>“Why not? Come, now, you have imagined because I
accepted your aid in getting out of the convent, that I was
in so far bound to worship you, did you not?”</p>
<p>A wave of hot blood surged into my cheeks; my ears
hummed. I suddenly realised the fact that I had been
making a fool of myself in a most lamentable fashion, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
this girl had most shamefully turned me into ridicule.
Indignation and anger took complete possession of me; I
poured out all my bile in a perfect torrent of words. I
stood for some little time clutching the grating, gazing at
her in silence with flaming eyes. Finally, in a voice hoarse
with anger, I said,—</p>
<p>“The truth is, you are the veriest flirt,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_16" id="FNanchor_16">[16]</a> unworthy of
receiving the attentions of any decent man. I do not
regret the time that I have wasted in loving you, but I
do regret having wasted my love on you! I believed that
under your apparent frivolity you had a good heart, but I
see that it was nothing but vanity and giddiness. I rejoice
that I have found it out in good time, for I will at one blow
tear it out of my heart and my thoughts, where you ought
never to have found a place. Good-bye! and for ever!”</p>
<p>As I withdrew my contracted hands from the iron bars I
felt the pressure of hers, and I heard a compressed laugh,
which entirely confused me.</p>
<p>“Bravo, bravo? I like you so, my dear! I was becoming
weary of so much sweetness!”</p>
<p>“What does this mean, Gloria?”</p>
<p>“It means that you must not be so honey-like, for one
gets tired of syrup, and incense is sickening. See here!
You have advanced your cause more in one moment by
saying impudent things to me, than in three months of
flatteries. You will say that I like to have my knuckles
rapped with the fire-shovel. It may be so. But I tell you
that a little touch of genius never hurts a man!”</p>
<p>“Yes? Then wait a bit, and I will insult you some
more,” said I, laughing.</p>
<p>“No, no,” she exclaimed, also laughing, “enough for
to-day.”</p>
<p>During that sweet and memorable interview, which was
prolonged till one o’clock, our love was mutually confessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
and agreed upon. Without any difficulty we began to
address each other with the familiar “thee” and “thou,”
and we swore fidelity till death, no matter what might happen.</p>
<p>Not a soul passed through the street. The watchman,
when he saw me glued to the grating, did not come near.
I was afraid that Doña Tula might come into the room,
but Gloria re-assured me by declaring that in Seville no one
ever acted traitorously towards two lovers, and the watchmen
still less interfered with these colloquies at the gratings,
which they saw every night. She also had great
confidence in the servants. Therefore the prospect of a
series of delightful interviews was spread before us, filling
my soul with joy.</p>
<p>“They will know about it sooner or later,” said she.
“But suppose they do. I will take it upon me to make
them mind their own business if they attempt to interfere.”</p>
<p>And in her handsome eyes I saw a flash of audacious
mischief, which made it plain enough that it would not be
an easy matter to lead her in paths where she did not wish
to go.</p>
<p>“Now it is getting late. Mamma gets up very early for
mass, and will wish me to go with her. Now you must go.”</p>
<p>“A little while longer, sweetheart! It is not midnight
yet.”</p>
<p>“Yes, the clock in the Giralda<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_17" id="FNanchor_17">[17]</a> struck one.”</p>
<p>“No, it is only a quarter-past twelve....”</p>
<p>The slow, solemn stroke of the bell in the Giralda just
then struck a quarter-past one.</p>
<p>“Do you hear? It is a quarter-past one. Adios! adios!”</p>
<p>“And are you going to send me off so, without giving
me your hand?”</p>
<p>She reached it out to me, and I, naturally, was about to
kiss it, but she snatched it away.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>
<p>“No, no; wait a little, I will give you the crucifix, as in
Marmolejo,” she cried with a laugh.</p>
<p>“I prefer your hand.”</p>
<p>“You heretic, begone!”</p>
<p>“God is everywhere. But still if you wish to give me the
crucifix I will guard it carefully as a keepsake.”</p>
<p>“Wait just a second. I have my dress here.”</p>
<p>She withdrew from the window for a moment and came
back with the bronze crucifix, which she handed out to me
through the iron grating. In taking it from her I got possession
of her brown, firm hand, and kissed it a number of
times voraciously, gluttonously!</p>
<p>“That will do, little boy. Do you expect to keep it up
till morning?”</p>
<p>I went away from that window grating intoxicated with
love and bliss. So far gone was I that when I met the
watchman a little distance away I gave him two pesetas.
Afterwards I regretted it, for there was no need of doing so,
according to what Gloria had said. This time, also, I noticed
as little as before whether the stars were glittering on high
with sweet brilliancy, or whether the moonlight filtered down
into the dark labyrinthine streets, spotting them here and
there with patines of bright silver. I carried in my own
heart a radiant sun, which dazzled me and prevented me
from seeing such petty details!</p>
<p class="center">III. <span class="allsmcap">A VISIT TO THE CONVENT.</span></p>
<p>... During all this time neither the Mother Superior
nor the sisters had asked who I was, or how and why Gloria
happened to be in that place. They looked at me with
quick glances of curiosity, showing that my presence embarrassed
them. I had not opened my lips.</p>
<p>My wife, doubtless piqued by this neglect, suddenly
said, “Did you not know that I was married?”</p>
<p>The sisters burst into a laugh.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>
<p>“Ay! what a Sister!—always so full of spirit,” exclaimed
the Mother Superior.</p>
<p>“Yes, Mother, I have been married for a month and
three days to this fine young man whom you see. He has
only one defect,” she added, growing grave, “and that is
that he is a Gallegan!... But you would not think it,
would you?”</p>
<p>“What a Sister!” again exclaimed some of the nuns.
“How witty she is!—who would have said that she was
married! Something has happened to her!”</p>
<p>“What! Don’t you believe me?”</p>
<p>The Sisters still laughed, giving me keen and mysterious
glances.</p>
<p>“Well, then, this very instant I will prove it to you!”
exclaimed my wife with a sudden impulse. And at the
same time she threw her arms around my neck and began
to give me some ringing kisses on the cheek, saying,—</p>
<p>“<i>Rico mio!</i> Isn’t it true that you are my husband?
Isn’t it true that I am your little wife? Isn’t it true that we
are married? Tell me, sweetheart! Tell me, my own life!”</p>
<p>While I, quite abashed, was trying to escape from her
caresses, I heard exclamations of reproof, and saw that the
nuns were flying in fright towards the portal. One of them,
more intrepid, seized the cord of the curtain and pulled it
with all her force. The curtain, as it shut together, likewise
sent up a squeak of scandalised amazement.</p>
<p>I heard hurried steps and a sound of voices. Then
nothing; it had grown silent.</p>
<p>My wife, laughing merrily and blushing at the same time,
seized my hand and drew me out. We passed through the
melancholy corridors in this way, ran down the stairs,
passed through the great passageway, and when we found
ourselves in the street I said to her, half vexed, “Child,
how crazy you were! What got into you, to....”</p>
<p>“Forgive me, my dear,” she replied, still laughing and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
crimson. “They made me nervous. They might as well
know that we were married as the priest who gave us
his benediction.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PEPITA"> <i>PEPITA.</i></h2>
</div>
<p>In the past few days I have had occasion to practise
patience in an extreme degree, and to mortify my self-love
in the most cruel manner. My father, wishing to return
Pepita’s compliment of the garden-party, invited her to visit
his villa at the Pozo de la Solana. The excursion took place
on the 22nd of April. I shall not soon forget the date.</p>
<p>The Pozo de la Solana is about two leagues distant from
the village, and the only road to it is a bridle-path. We all
had to go on horseback. As I never learned to ride, I had
on former occasions accompanied my father mounted on a
pacing mule, gentle, and, according to the expression of
Dientes the muleteer, as good as gold, and of easier motion
than a carriage. On the journey to the Pozo de la Solana
I went in the same manner.</p>
<p>My father, the notary, the apothecary, and my cousin
Currito were mounted on good horses. My aunt, Doña
Casilda, who weighs more than two hundred and fifty
pounds, rode on a large and powerful donkey, seated in
a commodious side-saddle. The reverend vicar rode a
gentle and easy mule like mine.</p>
<p>As for Pepita Jiménez, who, I supposed, would go also
mounted on a donkey, in the same sort of easy saddle as
my aunt—for I was ignorant that she knew how to ride—she
surprised me by making her appearance on a black and
white horse full of fire and spirit. She wore a riding-habit,
and managed her horse with admirable grace and skill.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="illus-b276">
<img alt="" src="images/illus-b276.jpg" id="id-7532351057623155912">
<div class="caption">“SHE WORE A RIDING-HABIT, AND MANAGED HER HORSE WITH
ADMIRABLE GRACE AND SKILL.”</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>
<p>I was pleased to see Pepita look so charming on horseback,
but I soon began to foresee and to be mortified by
the sorry part I would play, jogging on in the rear beside
my corpulent Aunt Casilda and the vicar, all three as quiet
and tranquil as if we were seated in a carriage, while the
gay cavalcade in front would caracole, gallop, trot, and
make a thousand other displays of their horsemanship.</p>
<p>I fancied on the instant that there was something of
compassion in Pepita’s  glance as she noted the pitiable
appearance I no doubt presented, seated on my mule. My
cousin Currito looked at me with a mocking smile, and
immediately began to make fun of me and to tease me.</p>
<p>Confess that I deserve credit for my resignation and
courage. I submitted to everything with a good grace,
and Currito’s jests soon ceased when he saw that I was invulnerable
to them. But what did I not suffer in secret!
The others, now trotting, now galloping, rode in advance of
us, both in going and returning. The vicar and I, with
Doña Casilda between us, rode on, tranquil as the mules
we were seated upon, without hastening or retarding our
pace.</p>
<p>I had not even the consolation of chatting with the vicar,
in whose conversation I find so much pleasure, nor of
wrapping myself up in my own thoughts and giving the rein
to my fancy, nor of silently admiring the beauty of the
scenery around us. Doña Casilda is gifted with an
abominable loquacity, and we were obliged to listen to her.
She told us all there is to be told of the gossip of the
village; she recounted to us all her accomplishments;
she told us how to make sausages, brain-puddings, pastry,
and innumerable other dishes and delicacies. There is
no one, according to herself, who can rival her in matters
pertaining to the kitchen, or to the dressing of hogs, but
Antoñona, Pepita’s nurse, and now her housekeeper and
general manager. I am already acquainted with this Antoñona,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
for she goes back and forth between her mistress’s
house and ours with messages, and is in truth extremely
handy—as loquacious as Aunt Casilda, but a great deal
more discreet.</p>
<p>The scenery on the road to the Pozo de la Solana is
charming, but my mind was so disturbed during our
journey that I could not enjoy it. When we arrived at the
villa and dismounted, I was relieved of a great load, as if it
had been I who carried the mule, and not the mule who
carried me.</p>
<p>We then proceeded on foot through the estate, which is
magnificent, of varied character and extensive. There are
vines, old and newly planted, all on the same property,
producing more than five hundred bushels of grapes; olive-trees
that yield to the same amount; and, finally, a grove
of the most majestic oaks that are to be found in all Andalusia.
The water of the Pozo de la Solana forms a clear
and deep brook, at which all the birds of the neighbourhood
come to drink, and on whose borders they are caught
by hundreds, by means of reeds smeared with bird-lime, or
of nets, in the centre of which are fastened a cord and a
decoy. All this carried my thoughts back to the sports of
my childhood, and to the many times that I too had gone
to catch birds in the same manner.</p>
<p>Following the course of the brook, and especially in the
ravines, are many poplars and other tall trees, which,
together with the bushes and the shrubs, form a dark and
labyrinthine wood. A thousand fragrant wild flowers grow
there spontaneously, and it would, in truth, be difficult to
imagine anything more secluded and sylvan, more solitary,
peaceful, and silent than this spot. Even in the fervour of
noonday, when the sun pours down his light in torrents
from a heaven without a cloud, the mind experiences the
same mysterious terror as visits it at times in the silent
hours of the night. One can understand here the manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
of life of the patriarchs of old, and of the primitive shepherds
and heroes; and the visions and apparitions that
appeared to them of nymphs, of gods, and of angels, in the
midst of the noonday brightness.</p>
<p>As we walked through this thicket, there arrived a
moment in which, I know not how, Pepita and I found
ourselves alone together. The others had remained
behind.</p>
<p>I felt a sudden thrill pass through me. For the first
time, and in a place so solitary, I found myself alone with
this woman; while my thoughts were still dwelling on the
noontide apparitions, now sinister, now gracious, but always
supernatural, vouchsafed to the men of remote ages.</p>
<p>Pepita had left the long skirt of her riding habit in the
house, and now wore a short dress that did not interfere
with the graceful ease of her movements. She had on her
head a little Andalusian hat, which became her extremely.
She carried in her hand her riding-whip, which I fancied to
myself to be a magic wand, by means of which this enchantress
might cast her spells over me.</p>
<p>I am not afraid to transcribe here these eulogies of her
beauty. In this sylvan scene she appeared to me more
beautiful than ever. The precaution recommended in
similar cases by ascetics, to think of her beauty defaced by
sickness and old age, to picture her to myself dead, the
prey of corruption and of the worm, presented itself, against
my will, to my imagination; and I say <i>against my will</i>, for
I do not concur in the necessity for such a precaution.
No thought of the material, no suggestion of the evil spirit,
troubled my reason or infected my will or my senses.</p>
<p>What did occur to me was an argument—at least to my
mind—in disproof of the efficacy of this precaution. Beauty,
the creation of a Sovereign and Divine Power, may indeed
be frail and ephemeral, may vanish in an instant; but the
idea of beauty is eternal, and, once perceived by the mind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
it lives there an immortal life. The beauty of this woman,
such as it manifests itself to-day, will disappear in a few
short years; the graceful form, those charming contours,
the noble head that raises itself so proudly above her
shoulders: all will be food for loathsome worms; but—though
the material must of necessity be transformed—its
idea, the creative thought—abstract beauty, in a word—what
shall destroy this? Does it not exist in the Divine
Mind? Once perceived and known by me, must it not
continue to live in my soul, triumphing over age and even
over death?</p>
<p>I was meditating thus, striving to tranquillise my spirit
and to dissipate the doubts which you have succeeded in
infusing into my mind, when Pepita and I encountered
each other. I was pleased and at the same time troubled
to find myself alone with her—hoping and yet fearing that
the others would join us.</p>
<p>The silvery voice of Pepita broke the silence, and drew
me from my meditations, saying—</p>
<p>“How silent you are, Don Luis, and how sad! I am
pained to think that it is perhaps through my fault, or partly
so at least, that your father has caused you to spend a disagreeable
day in these solitudes, taking you away from
a solitude more congenial, where there would be nothing to
distract your attention from your prayers and pious books.”</p>
<p>I know not what answer I made to this. It must have
been something nonsensical, for my mind was troubled. I
did not wish to flatter Pepita by paying her profane compliments,
nor, on the other hand, did I wish to answer her
rudely.</p>
<p>She continued—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>
<p>“You must forgive me if I am wrong, but I fancy that,
in addition to the annoyance of seeing yourself deprived
to-day of your favourite occupation, there is something else
that powerfully contributes to your ill-humour.”</p>
<p>“And what is this something else?” I said, “since you
have discovered it, or fancy you have done so.”</p>
<p>“This something else,” responded Pepita, “is a feeling
not altogether becoming in one who is going to be a priest
so soon, but very natural in a young man of twenty-two.”</p>
<p>On hearing this I felt the blood mount to my face, and
my face burn. I imagined a thousand absurdities; I
thought myself beset by evil spirits; I fancied myself
tempted by Pepita, who was doubtless about to let me
understand that she knew I loved her. Then my timidity
gave place to haughtiness, and I looked her steadily in the
face. There must have been something laughable in my
look, but either Pepita did not observe it, or, if she did, she
concealed the fact with amiable discretion; for she exclaimed,
in the most natural manner—</p>
<p>“Do not be offended because I find you are not without
fault. This that I have observed seems to me a slight one.
You are hurt by the jests of Currito, and by being compelled
to play—speaking profanely—a not very dignified
<i>rôle</i>, mounted, like the reverend vicar with his eighty years,
on a placid mule, and not, as a youth of your age and condition
should be, on a spirited horse. The fault is the
reverend dea, to whom it did not occur that you should
learn to ride. To know how to manage a horse is not
opposed to the career you intend to follow, and I think,
now that you are here, that your father might in a few days
give you the necessary instruction to enable you to do so.
If you should go to Persia or to China, where there are no
railroads yet, you will make but a sorry figure in those
countries as a bad horseman. It is possible even that, by
this oversight, the missionary himself may come to lose
prestige in the eyes of those barbarians, which will make
it all the more difficult for him to reap the fruits of his
labours.”</p>
<p>This and other arguments Pepita adduced in order to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
persuade me to learn to ride on horseback; and I was
so convinced of the necessity of a missionary’s being a
good horseman, that I promised her to learn at once, taking
my father as a teacher.</p>
<p>“On the very next expedition we make,” I said, “I
shall ride the most spirited horse my father has, instead of
the mule I am riding to-day.”</p>
<p>“I shall be very glad of it,” responded Pepita, with a
smile of indescribable sweetness.</p>
<p>At this moment we were joined by the rest of the party,
at which I was secretly rejoiced, though for no other
reason than the fear of not being able to sustain the conversation,
and of saying a great many foolish things, on
account of the little experience I have had in conversing
with women.</p>
<p>After our walk my father’s servants spread before us on
the fresh grass, in the most charming spot beside the brook,
a rural and abundant collation.</p>
<p>The conversation was very animated, and Pepita sustained
her part in it with much discretion and intelligence.
My cousin Currito returned to his jests about my manner
of riding and the meekness of my mule. He called me a
theologian, and said that, seated on mule-back, I looked
as if I were dispensing blessings. This time, however,
being now firmly resolved to learn to ride, I answered his
jests with sarcastic indifference. I was silent, nevertheless,
with respect to the promise I had just made Pepita.
The latter, doubtless thinking as I did—although we had
come to no understanding in the matter—that silence
for the present was necessary to insure the complete
success of the surprise that I would create afterward by
my knowledge of horsemanship, said nothing of our conversation.
Thus it happened, naturally and in the simplest
manner, that a secret existed between us; and it produced
in my mind a singular effect.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span></p>
<p>Nothing else worth telling occurred during the day.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we returned to the village in the same
manner in which we had left it. Yet, seated on my easygoing
mule and at the side of my aunt Casilda, I did not
experience the same fatigue or sadness as before.</p>
<p>During the whole journey I listened without weariness
to my aunt’s stories, amusing myself at times in conjuring
up idle fancies. Nothing of what passes in my soul shall
be concealed from you. I confess, then, that the figure of
Pepita was, as it were, the centre, or rather the nucleus and
focus, of these idle fancies.</p>
<p>The noonday vision in which she had appeared to me,
in the shadiest and most sequestered part of the grove,
brought to my memory all the visions, holy and unholy,
of wondrous beings, of a condition superior to ours, that
I had read of in sacred authors and in the profane classics.
Pepita appeared to the eyes and on the stage of my fancy
in the leafy seclusion of the grove, not as she rode before
us on horseback, but in an ideal and ethereal fashion—as
Venus to Æneas, as Minerva to Callimachus, as the sylph
who afterward became the mother of Libusa to the
Bohemian Kroco, as Diana to the son of Aristæus, as the
angels in the valley of Mamre to the Patriarch, as the
hippocentaur to St. Anthony in the solitude of the wilderness.</p>
<p>That the vision of Pepita should assume in my mind
something of a supernatural character, seems to me no
more to be wondered at than any of these. For an
instant, seeing the consistency of the illusion, I thought
myself tempted by evil spirits; but I reflected that in the
few moments during which I had been alone with Pepita
near the brook of the Solana, nothing had occurred that
was not natural or commonplace; that it was afterward,
as I rode along quietly on my mule, that some demon,
hovering invisible around me, had suggested these extravagant
fancies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span></p>
<p>That night I told my father of my desire to learn to ride.
I did not wish to conceal from him that it was Pepita
who had suggested this desire. My father was greatly
rejoiced; he embraced me, he kissed me, he said that now
not you only would be my teacher, but that he also would
have the pleasure of teaching me something. He ended
by assuring me that in two or three weeks he would make
me the best horseman of all Andalusia; able to go to
Gibraltar for contraband goods, and come back laden with
tobacco and cotton, after eluding the vigilance of the
Custom-house officers; fit, in a word, to astonish the riders
who show off their horsemanship in the fairs of Seville
and Mairena, and worthy to press the flanks of Babieca,<a class="fnanchor pginternal" href="#Footnote_18" id="FNanchor_18">[18]</a>
Bucephalus, or even of the horses of the sun themselves, if
they should by chance descend to earth, and I could catch
them by the bridle.</p>
<p>I don’t know what you will think of this notion of my
learning to ride, but I take it for granted you will see
nothing wrong in it.</p>
<p>If you could but see how happy my father is, and how
he delights in teaching me! Since the day after the
excursion I told you of, I take two lessons daily. There
are days on which the lesson is continuous, for we spend
from morning till night on horseback. During the first
week the lessons took place in the courtyard of the
house, which is unpaved, and which served as a riding-school.</p>
<p>We now ride out into the country, but manage so that
no one shall see us. My father does not want me to
show myself on horseback in public until I am able to
astonish every one by my fine appearance in the saddle,
as he says. If the vanity natural to a father does not
deceive him, this, it seems, will be very soon, for I have a
wonderful aptitude for riding.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span></p>
<p>“It is easy to see that you are my son!” my father
exclaims with joy, as he watches my progress.</p>
<p>My father is so good that I hope you will pardon him
the profane language and irreverent jests in which he
indulges at times. I grieve for this at the bottom of my
soul, but I endure it with patience. These constant and
long-continued lessons have reduced me to a pitiable
condition with blisters. My father enjoins me to write to
you that they are caused by mortification of the flesh.</p>
<p>As he declares that within a few weeks I shall be an
accomplished horseman, and he does not desire to be
superannuated as a master, he proposes to teach me other
accomplishments of a somewhat irregular character, and
sufficiently unsuited to a future priest. At times he proposes
to train me in throwing the bull, in order that he may
take me afterwards to Seville, where, with lance in hand,
on the plains of Tablada, I shall make the braggarts and
the bullies stare. Then he recalls his own youthful days,
when he belonged to the body-guard, and declares that he
will look up his foils, gloves, and masks, and teach me to
fence. And, finally, as my father flatters himself that he
can wield the Sevillian knife better than any one else, he
has offered to teach me even this accomplishment also.</p>
<p>You can already imagine the answer I make to all this
nonsense. My father replies that, in the good old times,
not only the priests, but even the bishops themselves, rode
about the country on horseback, putting infidels to the
sword. I rejoin that this might happen in the Dark Ages,
but then in our days the ministers of the Most High should
know how to wield no other weapons than those of persuasion.
“And what if persuasion be not enough?” rejoins
my father. “Do you think it would be amiss to
re-enforce argument with a few good blows of a cudgel?”
The complete missionary, according to my father’s opinion,
should know how on occasion to have recourse to these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
heroic measures, and as my father has read a great many
tales and romances he cites various examples in support
of his opinion. He cites, in the first place, St. James,
who on his white horse, without ceasing to be an apostle,
put more Moors to the sword than he preached to or
convinced; he cites a certain Señor de la Vera, who,
being sent on an embassy to Boabdil by Ferdinand and
Isabella, became entangled in a theological discussion with
the Moors in the courtyard of the Lions, and, being at
the end of his arguments, drew his sword and fell upon
them with fury in order to complete their conversion; and
he finally cites the Biscayan hidalgo, Don Inigo de Loyola,
who, in a controversy he had with a Moor regarding the
purity of the Holy Virgin, growing weary at last of the
impious and horrible blasphemies with which the aforesaid
Moor contradicted him, fell upon him, sword in hand, and,
if he had not taken to his heels, would have enforced
conviction upon his soul in a terrible fashion. In regard
to the incident relating to St. Ignatius, I answer my father
that this was before the saint became a priest; and in
regard to the other examples, I answer that historians are
not agreed.</p>
<p>In short, I defend myself as best I can against my father’s
jests, and I content myself with being a good horseman,
without learning other accomplishments unsuited to the
clergy, although my father assures me that not a few of the
Spanish clergy understand and practise them with frequency
in Spain, even in our own day, with a view to contributing
to the triumph of the faith, and to the preservation
or the restoration of the unity of the Church.</p>
<p>I am grieved to the soul by this levity of my father’s,
and that he should speak with irreverence and jestingly
about the most serious things; but a respectful son is not
called upon to go further than I do in repressing his
somewhat Voltairean freedom of speech. I say <i>Voltairean</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
because I am not able to describe it by any other word.
At heart my father is a good Catholic, and this thought
consoles me.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the Feast of the Cross, and the village
presented a very animated appearance. In each street
were six or seven May-crosses covered with flowers, but
none of them was so beautiful as that placed by Pepita at
the door of her house. It was adorned by a perfect
cascade of flowers.</p>
<p>In the evening we went to an entertainment at the
house of Pepita. The cross which had stood at the door
was now placed in a large saloon on the ground-floor, in
which there is a piano, and Pepita presented us with a
simple and poetic spectacle—one that I had seen when
a child, but had since forgotten.</p>
<p>From the upper part of the cross hung down seven
bands or broad ribbons, two white, two green, and three
red, the symbolic colours of the theological virtues.
Eight children, of five or six years old, representing the
seven sacraments, and holding the seven ribbons that
hung from the cross, performed with great skill a species
of contra-dance. The sacrament of baptism was represented
by a child wearing the white robe of a catechumen;
ordination, by another child as a priest; confirmation,
by a little bishop; extreme unction, by a pilgrim with staff
and scrip, the latter filled with shells; marriage, by a bride
and bridegroom; and penance, by a Nazarene with cross
and crown of thorns.</p>
<p>The dance was a series of reverences, steps, evolutions,
and genuflexions, rather than a dance, performed to the
sound of very tolerable music, something like a march,
which the organist played, not without skill, on the piano.</p>
<p>The little dancers, children of the servants or retainers
of Pepita, after playing their parts, went away to bed loaded
with gifts and caresses.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>
<p>The entertainment, in the course of which we were
served with refreshments, continued till twelve; the refreshments
were syrup served in little cups, and afterwards
chocolate with sponge-cake, and meringues and water.</p>
<p>Since the return of spring Pepita’s seclusion and retirement
are being gradually abandoned, at which my father is
greatly rejoiced. In future Pepita will receive every night,
and my father desires that I shall be one of the guests.</p>
<p>Pepita has left off mourning, and now appears, more
lovely and attractive than ever, in the lighter fabrics appropriate
to the season, which is almost summer. She still
dresses, however, with extreme simplicity.</p>
<p>I cherish the hope that my father will not now detain me
here beyond the end of this month at farthest. In June
we shall both join you in the city, and you shall then see
how, far from Pepita, to whom I am indifferent, and who
will remember me neither kindly nor unkindly, I shall have
the pleasure of embracing you, and attaining at last to the
happiness of being ordained.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">S<span class="smcap">t. Peter</span> was polishing the large knocker of the
Gate of Heaven, leaving it as bright as the sun—which
is not to be wondered at since the knocker St. Peter was
cleaning <i>is</i> the sun we see appearing every morning in the
east.</p>
<p>The holy porter, merrier than his colleagues at Madrid,
was humming some little air not unlike <i>Ça ira</i> of the
French.</p>
<p>“Hola! You get up very early,” said he, bending his head
and staring at a person who had stopped before the threshold
of the gate.</p>
<p>The unknown did not reply, but bit his lips, which were
thin, pale, and dry.</p>
<p>“No doubt,” continued St. Peter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span> “you are the savant
who was dying last night?... What a night you made me
pass, friend!... I never closed my eyes once, thinking
you might be likely to knock; my last orders were not to
let you wait a moment, a piece of respect paid to your sort
here in heaven. Well, welcome, and come in; I can’t leave
the gate. Go through, and then straight on.... There is
no entresol.”</p>
<div class="figcenter illowp80" id="illus-b292">

<div class="caption">“THE STRANGER DID NOT STIR FROM THE THRESHOLD.”</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>
<p>The stranger did not stir from the threshold, but fixed
his little blue eyes on the venerable bald head of St. Peter,
who had turned his back to go on rubbing up the sun.</p>
<p>The newcomer was thin, short, and sallow, with somewhat
feminine movements, neat in his attire, and without a
hair on his face. He wore his shroud elegantly and nicely
adjusted, and he measured his gestures with academic
severity.</p>
<p>After gazing for some time at St. Peter working, he
wheeled round and was about to return on the journey he
had come he knew not how; but he found he was standing
above a gloomy abyss, in which the darkness almost seemed
palpable, and a horrisonous tempest was roaring with flashes
of livid light at intervals like lightning. There was not a
trace of any stairs, and the machine by which he dimly
remembered he had mounted was not in sight either.</p>
<p>“Sir,” exclaimed he, in a vibrating and acrid voice: “May
I know what this means? Where am I? Why was I
brought here.”</p>
<p>“Ah, you haven’t gone yet; I am very glad, for I had
forgotten something.” And pulling his memorandum-book
out of his pocket, the saint moistened the point of the
pencil between his lips and asked—</p>
<p>“Your name?”</p>
<p>“I am Doctor Pertinax, author of the book stereotyped
in its twentieth edition, called ‘<i>Philosophia Ultima</i>.’...”</p>
<p>St. Peter was not a quick writer, and of all this had only
put down Pertinax....</p>
<p>“Well, Pertinax of what?”</p>
<p>“Of what? Oh, I see, you mean from where? just as
they say: Thales of Miletus, Parmenides of Elea....”</p>
<p>“Exactly, Quixote of la Mancha....”</p>
<p>“Write down, Pertinax of Torrelodones. And now,
may I know what this farce means?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span></p>
<p>“This farce?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. I am the victim of a farce, this is a comedy:
my enemies, my colleagues, with the help of subtle artifices
and theatrical machinery, exalting my mind with some
beverage, have doubtless prepared all this. But the deception
is useless. My power of reasoning is above all these
appearances, and protests with a mighty voice against this
low trickery; neither masks nor limelights are of any avail,
for I am not taken in by such palpable effrontery, and I say
what I always said, and which is enframed on page 315 of
my ”<i>Philosophia Ultima</i>,“ note <i>b.</i> of the sub-note Alpha,
<i>i.e.</i>, that after death the deception of appearances will not
exist, and there will no longer be any desire for life, <i>nolite
vivere</i>, which is only a chain of shadows linked with desires,
&amp;c., &amp;c.... Therefore, one of the two: either I have died,
or I have not died; if I have died, it cannot possibly be I as I
was when alive half an hour ago, and all that I see around
me, as it can only be a representation, is not, for I am not;
but if I have not died, and am myself, what I was and am,
it is clear that although what I see around me exists in me
by representation, it is not what my enemies wish me to
believe, but an unworthy farce designed to frighten me; but
’tis in vain, for....”</p>
<p>And the philosopher swore like a coal-heaver. And the
swearing was not the worst, for he lifted up his voice
towards Heaven, the inhabitants of which were beginning
to awake at the noise, while some of the blest were already
descending by the staircase of clouds, tinged some as with
woad, others with a sea-blue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile St. Peter held his sides with both hands to
keep from bursting into the laughter with which he was
nearly choking. Pertinax became more irritated at the
saint’s laughter, and the latter had to stop to try and pacify
him by the following words—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span></p>
<p>“My dear sir, farces are of no avail here, nor is it a
question of deceiving you, but of bringing you to Heaven,
which it appears you have merited for some good works of
which I am ignorant; in any case, calm yourself and go up,
for the inhabitants above are already astir, and you will find
somebody who will conduct you to where all will be explained
to your taste, so that not a shadow of doubt will
remain, for doubts all disappear in this region, where the
dullest thing is the sun which I am polishing.”</p>
<p>“I do not say <i>you</i> are deceiving me, for you seem an
honest man; the tricksters are others, and you only an
instrument, unconscious of what you are doing.”</p>
<p>“I am St. Peter....”</p>
<p>“They have persuaded you that you are; but there’s no
proof that you are.”</p>
<p>“Dear sir, I have been porter here for more than
eighteen hundred years....”</p>
<p>“Apprehension, preconception....”</p>
<p>“Preconception fiddlesticks!” cried the saint, now somewhat
angry; “I am St. Peter, and you a savant, and like all
that come to us, an ignorant fool, with more than one bee
in your bonnet....”</p>
<p>The gateway was now crowded with angels and cherubim,
saints, male and female, and a number of the blest, who
all formed a circle round the stranger and smilingly surveyed
him.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>From amongst them there stepped forth St. Job:—“I
think,” said he, “that this gentleman would be convinced
that he had lived in error if he could see the Universe as it
actually is. Why not appoint a commission from amongst
us to accompany Doctor Pertinax and show him the construction
of the immense piece of architecture, as Lope de
Vega says, whom I am sorry not to see among us.”</p>
<p>Great was the respect for St. Job, and they immediately
proceeded to a nominal vote, which took up a good deal of
time, as more than half the martyrology had repaired to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
gate. The following were by the results appointed members
of the commission:—St. Job, by acclamation; Diogenes,
by a majority; and St. Thomas the Apostle, by a majority.
St. Thomas of Aquinas and Duns Scotus had votes.</p>
<p>Dr. Pertinax gave way to the supplications of the commission,
and consented to survey all the machinery and
magic, with which they might deceive his eyes, said he, but
not his mind.</p>
<p>“My dear fellow, don’t be downhearted,” said St. Thomas,
as he sewed some wings on to the Doctor’s shoulder-blades:
“Look at me, I was an unbeliever, and....”</p>
<p>“Sir,” replied Pertinax, “you lived in very different
times, the world was then in its theological age, as Comte
said, and I have passed through all those ages and have
lived side by side with the ”<i>Criticisms of Pure Reason</i>“ and
the ”<i>Philosophia Ultima</i>“; so that I believe in nothing, not
even in the mother who bore me; I only believe in this,
inasmuch as I know that I am, I am conscious, but without
falling into the preconception of confounding representation
with essence, which is unattainable, that is to say, excepting
the being conscious, putting aside all that is not myself (and
all being in myself) I <i>know</i>, by knowing that everything is
represented (and I as everything else) by simply appearing
to be what it is, and the reality of which is only investigated
by another volitive and effective representation, a harmful
representation, being irrational and the original sin of
the Fall; therefore, this apparent desire undone, nothing
remains to explore, since not even the will for knowledge
remains.”</p>
<p>Only St. Job heard the last word of this discourse, and,
scratching his bald crown with his potsherd, he replied—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>
<p>“The truth is, you savants are the very devil for talking
nonsense, and do be offended, but those things, whether
in your head or imagination, as you please, will give you
warm work to see them in reality as they are.”</p>
<p>“Forward! forward!” shouted Diogenes at this moment;
“the sophists denied me motion, and you know how I
proved it; forward!”</p>
<p>And they began their flight through boundless space.
Boundless? Pertinax thought it so, and said—</p>
<p>“Do you expect to show me all the Universe?”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” replied St. Thomas.</p>
<p>“But since the Universe—seemingly, of course—is infinite
... how can you conceive the limit of space?”</p>
<p>“Conceive it, with difficulty; but see it, easily. Aristoteles
sees it every day, for he takes the most terrible
walks with his disciples, and certainly he complained that
the space for walking ended before the disputes of his peripatetics.”</p>
<p>“But how can space have an end? If there is a limit, it
will have to be nothing; but as nothing does not exist, it
cannot form a boundary; for a boundary is something, and
something apart from what is bounded.”</p>
<p>St. Job, who was already growing impatient, cut him
short—</p>
<p>“Enough, enough of conversation! but you had better
bend your head so as not to knock it, for we have arrived
at that limit of space which cannot be conceived, and if
you take a step more, you will break your head against that
nothing you are denying.”</p>
<p>And effectually; Pertinax saw there was nothing more
beyond; wished to feel it, and bumped his head.</p>
<p>“But this can’t be!” he exclaimed, while St. Thomas
applied to the bump one of those pieces of money which
pagans take with them on their journey to the other world.</p>
<p>There was no help for it, they had to turn back, the
Universe had come to an end. But ended or not, how
beautiful shone the firmament with its millions and millions
of stars!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>
<p>“What is that dazzling light shining above there, higher
than all the constellations? Is it some nebula unknown to
the astronomers of the earth?”</p>
<p>“A pretty nebula!” replied St. Thomas; “that is the
celestial Jerusalem, from which we have just descended, and
what is shining so are the diamond walls round the city of
God.”</p>
<p>“So that those marvels related by Chateaubriand, and
which I thought unworthy of a serious man...?”</p>
<p>“Are perfectly true, my friend. And now let us go and
rest on that star passing below there, for i’ faith, I am tired
of so much going backwards and forwards.”</p>
<p>“Gentlemen, I am not presentable,” said Pertinax; “I
have not yet doffed my shroud, and the inhabitants of this
star will laugh at such indecorous garb....”</p>
<p>The three Ciceroni of Heaven all burst out laughing
together. Diogenes was the first to exclaim—</p>
<p>“Though I should lend you my lantern, you would not
meet a living soul in that star, nor in any other star.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” added Job, very seriously, “there are no
inhabitants except on the Earth; don’t talk such nonsense.”</p>
<p>“This I cannot believe!”</p>
<p>“Well, let us go and show him,” said St. Thomas, who
was already growing angry. And they journeyed from star to
star, and in a few minutes had traversed all the Milky Way
and the most distant starry systems. Nothing, not a sign
of life. They did not even encounter a flea, for all the
numerous globes they surveyed. Pertinax was horrified.</p>
<p>“This is the Creation!” he exclaimed; “what solitude!
Come, show me the Earth; I want to see that privileged
region; by what I conjecture, all modern cosmography is a
lie, the Earth is still, and the centre of all the celestial
vault; and round her revolve the suns and planets, and
she is the largest of all the spheres....”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” replied St. Thomas;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span> “astronomy is not
mistaken; the earth revolves round the sun, and you will
soon see how insignificant she appears. Let us see if we
can find her amongst all that crowd of stars. <i>You</i> look for
her, St. Job; <i>you</i> have plenty of patience.”</p>
<p>“I will!” exclaimed the Saint of the potsherd, as he
hooked his spectacles round his ears.</p>
<p>“It is like looking for a needle in a bottle of hay!... I
see her! there she goes! look! look how small! she looks
like a microbe!”</p>
<p>Pertinax looked at the Earth and sighed.</p>
<p>“And are there no inhabitants except on that mote?”</p>
<p>“Nowhere else.”</p>
<p>“And the rest of the Universe is empty?”</p>
<p>“Empty.”</p>
<p>“Then of what use are such millions and millions of
stars?”</p>
<p>“As lamps. They are the public illumination of the
Earth. And they are also useful for singing praises to the
Almighty. And they serve as eke-outs in poetry, and you
can’t deny they are very pretty.”</p>
<p>“But all empty?”</p>
<p>“Every one!”</p>
<p>Pertinax remained in the air for a good time sad and
thoughtful. He felt ill. The edifice of his “<i>Philosophia
Ultima</i>” was threatening ruin. Upon seeing that the Universe
was so different from what reason demanded, he began
to believe in the Universe. That brusque lesson of reality
was the rude and cold contact with material which his spirit
needed in order to believe. “It is all so badly arranged,
but perhaps it is true!” thus thought the philosopher.
Suddenly he turned to his companions, and asked them—“Does
Hell exist?”</p>
<p>The three sighed, made gestures of compassion, and
replied—</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span></p>
<p>“Yes; it exists.”</p>
<p>“And condemnation is eternal?”</p>
<p>“Eternal.”</p>
<p>“A solemn injustice!”</p>
<p>“A terrible reality!” replied the three in chorus.</p>
<p>Pertinax wiped his brow with his shroud. He was perspiring
philosophy. He began to believe that he was in the
other world. The injustice of everything convinced him.
“Then the cosmogony and the theogony of my infancy was
the truth?”</p>
<p>“Yes; the first and only philosophy.”</p>
<p>“Then I am not dreaming?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Confession! confession!” groaned the philosopher; and
he swooned into the arms of Diogenes.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>When he awoke, he found himself in his bed. His old
servant and the priest were by his side.</p>
<p>“Here is the confessor, sir, for whom you asked....”</p>
<p>Pertinax sat up, stretched out both hands, and looking at
the confessor with frightened eyes, cried—</p>
<p>“I say and repeat, that all is pure representation, and
that I am the victim of an unworthy farce.”——And he
expired really.</p>

<p>A certain Pacha had a daughter who had three
suitors. When her father asked her which of the
three she would marry, she replied she wanted all three.
To this he replied it was impossible, no woman ever had
three husbands; but the girl, who was wilful and spoilt,
persisted, and at last the good Pacha in despair called the
three suitors before him and told them he would give his
daughter to whichever returned with the most wonderful
thing within a year’s time. The three suitors set out in
quest, and after vainly wandering about the world for many
months, one of them met a witch who showed him a looking-glass
in which you saw whatever you wished to see.
This he bought from her. The second suitor also met this
witch, who sold him a strip of carpet, which, when you sat
upon it, carried you to wherever you wished to go; while
the third suitor bought from her a salve, the which, when
applied to the lips of a newly laid out corpse returned the
body to life. Now the three suitors met, and showed each
other their respective finds.</p>
<p>“Let us wish to see our fair mistress,” said one; and
they wished and looked into the mirror, when, lo and behold!
they saw her dead, laid out in her coffin ready for
burial. They were overwhelmed with grief.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span></p>
<p>“My salve will restore her to life,” said the third suitor,
“but by the time we get to her she will have been long
buried and devoured by worms.”</p>
<p>“But my carpet will take us to her at once,” cried the
second suitor, and so they all sat down on it and wished.</p>
<p>In a trice they found themselves in the Pacha’s palace,
and the salve was applied to the dead girl’s lips. She
immediately came to life again, sat up, and looking at the
Pacha said—</p>
<p>“I was right, you see, father, when I wanted all three.”</p>

<i>(Abridged from) Fernan Caballero.</i></p>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Pér Solution of the Difficulty.</span></p>
<p>There was in the village of Abadiano a certain farmer
called Chomin, who had made a prodigious fortune by
his devotion to a number of saints of both sexes.</p>
<p>When first married he possessed nothing beyond his wife
and a dog; but it occurred to him to make perpetual family
saints of St. Isidro, patron of farmers; St. Antonio, advocate
of animals; St. Roque, enemy of the plague; Santa
Lucia, protector of the sight; St. Barbara, enemy of
thunderbolts and lightning, and other innumerable saints,
to each of whom he offered up every night their respective
Pater Noster and Ave Maria, and certes, he struck a mine
of wealth by so doing, for from that moment he began to
prosper, and in such a way that after a few years he had the
best house and farm in the district of Gaztelua.</p>
<p>In Chomin’s house even a headache was unknown; the
wheat, which in Biscay generally produces sixteen bushels
for one sown, produced twenty-four for Chomin; the maize,
which nearly always produces thirty for one, produced forty
for Chomin; not a single head of his cattle had come to
grief, although he had many, and when a storm burst upon
the heights of Gorbea and Amboto, and the lightning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
flashed towards Abadiano, it always took good care to make
a little round so as to avoid passing over Chomin’s buildings
and property.</p>
<p>Chomin had a servant by name Péru, to whom he had
promised his daughter, Mari-Pepa, with whom Péru was in
love, and verily not without motive, for she was the prettiest
girl that came to dance on Sundays in the market-place of
Abadiano.</p>
<p>Péru was a hard worker, and as honest as the day; but
he had a very short memory, and was not over-intelligent;
it was related of him among other things, how one day that
Péru had to go to San Antonio de Urquiola, his master
having commissioned him to kiss the Saint for him, Péru,
instead of giving the kiss to the Saint, gave it to the Saint’s
pig, which always accompanies him. But in spite of this,
if he was in love with Mari-Pepa, she was still more in love
with him, for we know what women are like; they may dislike
a man for being poor, ugly, or wicked, but they don’t
mind how stupid he is.</p>
<p>One night, the eve of St. James, after the whole family,
under the direction of Chomin, had told their rosary, with
an extra rosary of Pater Nosters and Ave Marias to the
patron saints of the house, Chomin said to Péru—</p>
<p>“Listen, Péru. To-morrow begins the fair of Basurto,
and I am thinking of going there to see if I can buy a pair
of bullocks to rear and train, so that when you and Mari-Pepa
marry you may have a good yoke of oxen, for it is
already time to think of settling you.”</p>
<p>Péru and Mari-Pepa, upon hearing this, blushed as red
as cherries, and looked at each other with eyes dancing
with joy.</p>
<p>Chomin continued,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span> “I shall be away for at least a couple
of days, for until I come across a pair which will be the
pride of the country I wo come back. Meanwhile, Péru,
you will have to take my place at prayers, and be careful not
to forget the Pater Noster and Ave Maria for each of the
Saints who protect us.”</p>
<p>“don’t you worry about it,” replied Péru, “not a single
one shall be forgotten.”</p>
<p>“I hope not, Péru, for, you see, we owe them a great
deal. My wife and I had only one rag in front and another
behind when we made them our Saints, and to-day....
Well, you shall see a good few ounces of gold from the
sweepings of our stables on your and Mari-Pepa’s wedding-day!
But suppose you omit, for example, St. Barbara and
her corresponding Pater Noster and Ave Maria, and a tempest
bursts over us.... Lord Jesus, at the very thought
my legs tremble! Now let us see, Péru, if you know by
heart all the saints to whom you must pray.”</p>
<p>Péru recited the names of all the patrons of the family to
Chomin’s satisfaction, but the latter burdened his fealty in
the accomplishment of his task, by threatening that he
should not become his son-in-law if he did a single saint
out of their respective Pater Noster and Ave Maria, which
omission would be sure to be found out by the ill-luck
which would certainly happen to the family, house, property,
or cattle.</p>
<p>The next morning, after he had attended early mass,
Chomin took his way to the fair, now certain that Péru
would not pass over a single saint. Poor Péru took the
charge so much to heart, and above all the threat, that he
passed the whole night and next morning in trying to find
a sure way of not forgetting a single saint, but with no avail,
however much he racked his brains. And it was a serious
case, for Péru said to himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span> “I know all their names off
like a parrot, but as there are twenty-five besides the Virgin,
how can I help it if I give an Ave Maria or so short, and
there is an end to my marriage with Mari-Pepa? It would
be a pretty to-do if that happened, for I shall not find
another companion like her easily, and then Chomin won’t
let us leave the house without some household furniture, a
good yoke of oxen, and fifty ducats for the dowry.”</p>
<p>At the fall of evening all the village was dancing to the
sound of the tambourine in the market-place of Abadiano,
all except Péru and Mari-Pepa. Péru was sitting amidst
brambles and furze on a desolate slope overlooking the
village. Mari-Pepa was in the market-place close to the
village fountain, refusing to dance with anybody, and full of
grief at Péru’s state of mind.</p>
<p>Suddenly Péru uttered a shout of joy and flew down the
hill, seized Mari-Pepa, and began the maddest dance ever
seen in Abadiano. He had thought out an infallible way
how not to forget a single saint in the celestial city.</p>
<p>That evening, after praying to each of the particular
saints appointed by Chomin special patron saints of the
family, lest any should have been forgotten he prayed to
<i>all the saints in the celestial city,—and seven leagues without</i>,
in case any should be taking a walk.</p>

used to take such delicious cups of chocolate as only
holy friars do. An intimate friend of the friar, who was
extremely fond of chocolate, began visiting him very frequently,
and always at the hour in which his reverence
drank his chocolate, the friar being so courteous as to
always order another cup for his visitor. But as this friend
abused the father’s hospitality by coming day after day, the
latter complained of this sponging tendency, whereupon a
lay-friar, whose name was Father Cobos, declared that it
fell to him to give him a hint to drop this habit. To this
the Father Superior agreed. Noticing soon after that his
friend no longer came to the convent, and desirous to know
the lay-friar’s hint, he asked him after a fortnight what he
had said to make his friend leave off coming even to see
him.</p>
<p>“I gave him a hint,” replied Father Cobos.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span> “I said,
‘Look you, Don Fulano, don’t be so disobliging as to
take your chocolate at home; for the Father Superior says
you are such a tremendous glutton that it warms the cockles
of his heart every time he sees you.’”</p>
<p>The Father Superior was so amused at this that he
divulged the story, and since then the hints of Padre Cobos
have become proverbial throughout Spain.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-cap">I<span class="smcap">t</span> is not to be wondered at that a country so fecund in
heroes and men of genius as the home of Nelson,
Newton, and Byron, should also produce some very eccentric
men. Of no other sons of Adam are such whimsicalities
and oddities related as of those born in England.
At every step on the other side of the Channel one meets
with mad philosophers, who, if they unexpectedly inherit
a large fortune, instead of leading a sybaritic life, order a
schooner or brig to be built, embark straight away without
troubling about their destination, let the wind take them
whither it lists, swallow half-a-dozen bottles of rum, double
themselves into a berth, and mingle their snores with the
roaring of the waves until their craft strands on a shoal,
when the dampness of the ocean reminds them it’s time to
wake up.</p>
<p>I knew an Englishman poorer than a retired Spanish
ensign, and more miserly than an old clo’man, who, with
the help of a clever Newfoundland, which he loved like a
brother, saved the life of a lord’s daughter who had fallen
into the Thames. Ten years later, when he did not even
remember his generous deed, he received from the father of
the lord’s daughter a gift of £200,000 sterling. This stroke
of good luck produced no impression on his mind, to judge
by any outward expression of joy; and the following day
when his creditors came to congratulate him, they found
him, to their surprise, bathed in his own blood. Not far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
from the corpse lay a letter with the following contents: “Let
nobody be accused of my death, ascribe it still less to bad
fortune. I was happy in the act of suicide; I had good
health and money. And yet I felt inclined to kill myself
first, because I felt inclined, secondly, because from a boy
I had always wished for a capital of £100,000, and I find
myself with one hundred thousand more than I wanted. I
leave half my fortune to my Newfoundland dog, to be
invested in cat’s-meat, of which he is very fond, and the
other half to whoever undertakes to buy the cat’s-meat for
the dog. Witness my signature....”</p>
<p>Needless to say, that all who knew the last will and
testament of the deceased, wanted to discharge it, with no
further philanthropy than receiving the recompense. As
for the dog, which was present at the reading of his master’s
will, that so greatly concerned him, he did not show the
slightest sign of joy. However, the will was declared
invalid, and to avoid all disputes the £200,000 were
returned to the chest of the noble lord.</p>
<p>The latter, finding himself again possessor of funds of
which he had taken leave for ever, desired to use them to
satisfy a caprice, which should give him the fame, throughout
the whole country, of a wit. He laid a wager with a
rich tradesman that he would not sell a hundred thousand
sovereigns at a halfpenny each, though he should take his
stand for six hours in one of the most crowded spots of the
capital. This proposition deceived the tradesman as it
would have deceived anybody, and he agreed to take the
bet, the stakes being nothing less than £200,000, convinced
that it was impossible he could lose. There was a Court
<i>levée</i> that day, and a tremendous crowd of people were
crossing the Thames over Westminster Bridge towards St.
James’s Palace. The tradesman and the lord took up their
post one side of the bridge, behind a huge open chest, full
of sovereigns.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span> “A ha’penny each, sovereigns a ha’penny
each!” cried the tradesman, and the lord at his side did
nothing but laugh; the stipulations being that the lord
should only be allowed to laugh, and the tradesman to say
“A ha’penny each, sovereigns a ha’penny each!” The
people passed on, saying: “What a take in! Good
heavens! Sovereigns for a ha’penny. What will they be
like?” The tradesman began to despair. More than one
passer-by took up one of the coins, turned it round and
round, and then noticing the laughter which the lord
pretended he could not stifle, put the money back, saying,
“They are well imitated, but nobody can do me.”</p>
<p>“A ha’penny each, sovereigns a ha’penny each!” shouted
the tradesman unceasingly, and the more he exerted himself
to cry his ware, the more clearly did the public think they
saw through the trick by which he hoped to empty their
pockets. They stayed thus from nine in the morning till
three in the afternoon, the lord laughing and the tradesman
shouting. The result was that the latter lost the bet.
Only two sovereigns were sold, and these were bought by
a medical student, believing them to be false, but hoping to
pass them in a gambling den or other low place. When he
found they were accepted, he returned post-haste to Westminster
Bridge to lay in a new provision, but arrived too
late; the lord and the tradesman had already vanished.</p>

to wash out some baby-clothes. ... “Thy kingdom come,”

for as for eating, I eat very little, and some days a

them, who only slept there, for he ate with his mess, and
paid them ten reals for a tiny bedroom, and was always
making them presents besides; if he had an old pair of

to make a little jacket for herself. Now that all means

<p><span class="smcap">Alarcon, Pedro Antonio de</span>, perhaps the most popular Spanish
writer of the nineteenth century, was born in Guadix in 1833, and
was a member of a noble family of but little means. After studying
first jurisprudence, and afterwards theology, he devoted himself to
letters, for which he had always shown a strong proclivity. Amongst
the best known of his numerous works are “The Three-Cornered
Hat,” which is based on an old Spanish tale, somewhat Boccaccian
in flavour; “The Scandal”; “La Alpujarra,” the records of a
delightful trip in Andalusia; and several collections of short tales,
of which many have been translated into English—notably by
Mary J. Serrano (New York).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aleman, Mateo</span>, native of Seville, flourished in the year 1609. He

the life of a rogue than is the former’s Lazarillo, in his “Guzman
de Alfarache,” which appeared in 1553, forty-six years after its
prototype. Little is known of Aleman’s life; he seems to have
been long employed in the Treasury, and at last to have retired,
and devoted the rest of his life to letters. But he claims to be
remembered by his work, “Guzmann de Alfarache,” the popularity
of which was so immediate that, like “Don Quixote,” it provoked
a spurious “Second Part” before the real continuation appeared,
and was soon translated into the chief European tongues, French,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
Italian, German, Portuguese, and even Latin, and into excellent
English by Mabbe, whose contemporary, Ben Jonson, thus speaks

<p><span class="smcap">Calderon de la Barca, Pedro</span>, the great successor and rival of
Lope de Vega, was eminently a poet in the national temper, and
had a brilliant success. He was born at Madrid on January
17, 1600. After serving as a soldier he was, on the death of
Lope, formally attached to the Court, and was subsequently made
a Knight of the Order of Santiago. In 1651 he followed the
example of Lope de Vega and other men of letters by entering the
Church. He died in 1681, on the Feast of Pentecost, when all
Spain was ringing with his autos, and was buried in the splendid
church of Atocha. Calderon was remarkable for his personal
beauty, and was endowed with a benevolent and kindly character.
Of his autos, or religious plays, the “Wonder-working Magician” is
the most characteristic of the old Spanish stage (the question has
been raised if Goethe had not read it before he wrote “Faust,”
the plot being very similar). Of the secular dramas, “The Mayor
of Zalamea” is in Spain the most popular, and is still frequently
represented, while “Life is a Dream” is perhaps pre-eminent for
its brilliant flowing verse and philosophic thoughts. “The Mayor
of Zalamea,” though boisterous and jolly in the act given in the
text, winds up a tragedy of the first water.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Campoamor, Ramon de</span>, native of Asturias, September 24, 1817,
called by Blanco García the Poet “Philosopher” (a title disputed
by other critics), is one of the few modern Spanish poets whose fame
has crossed the frontier of the Peninsula, his works having been
studied in Italy and France. Like his late fellow-poet, Zorrilla, he
has reached a ripe old age, and his peculiar style (of which “If
She could only Write” is perhaps scarcely typical) has had several
imitators.</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Celestina; or, the Tragicomedy of Calisto and Melibœa</span>,”
is considered one of the chief foundations of the Spanish drama.
The first act was probably written by Rodrigo Cota of Toledo,
and it may be assumed that it was produced about 1480. The
rest was added by Fernando de Rojas de Montalvan. Unhappily,
large portions of this vigorous work abound in a shameless
libertinism. It was followed by many imitations, and was soon
translated into English, German, Dutch, Latin, Italian, and French.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cervantes de Saavedra (Miguel)</span> was a member of an old noble
family, decayed in fortune, and was born in the month of October
in 1547 in Alcalá de Henares. Here he probably received his
early education, which it has been conjectured he continued at
Madrid, and later on at the University of Salamanca. He discovered
a strong predilection for literature, but his necessities
seemed to have forced him to seek for a livelihood by some
other means. Anyway, in 1570 we find him serving at Rome
as chamberlain in the household of Cardinal Aquaviva; and he
subsequently entered the navy, and lost his left hand at the famous
sea-fight of Lepanto, which fight decisively arrested the intrusion
of the Turks into the West of Europe (October 7, 1571). His misfortune
did not prevent him joining the troops of the King of Spain
at Naples; but when returning to Spain by sea, he was made a
prisoner by pirates, who took him to Algiers, where for five years
he was kept as a slave. After this period he was ransomed, when
he went to Madrid. He married in 1584, and soon after began his
first literary efforts, which were for the stage. But after composing
some thirty plays with little pecuniary result, his genius was
diverted into a different channel, and he produced, in 1605, the
First Part of the immortal novel of “Don Quixote.” Inimitable in
its wit and humour as this work is, it was at first received with
comparative indifference. Ultimately, however, it met with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
greatest applause, although the author reaped few or none of the
emoluments which might have been expected from it. The Second
Part was not published till 1615, and was even superior to the first.
(Avellaneda’s spurious Second Part appeared in 1614.) Needless
to say, “Don Quixote” soon became known all over the civilised
world, and was translated into a multitude of tongues. The oldest
English translation is by Shenton, 1612, which is followed by a
vulgar, unfaithful, and coarse one by Milton’s nephew, John
Philips, 1712; one by Motteux; one by Jervas (Jarvis), 1742,
which Smollet used freely in his own, 1755; a few others of lesser
importance; and finally, in the eighties of the present century,
one by Mr. Ormsby; and Mr. H. E. Watt’s learned and faithful
work, from which the extracts have been drawn for this volume.
The other principal works of Cervantes are “The Journey to
Parnassus,” his Exemplary Novels, “Galatea,” and the unfinished
romance, “The Labours of Persiles and Sigismunda,” his last
work. Cervantes died on the 23rd of April, in the year 1616
(the year of Shakespeare’s death), at the age of sixty-eight.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chronicle of the Cid.</span> Southey’s so-called “Chronicle of the
Cid” is not a translation of any single work, but is based upon, i.
La Cronica del Cid; ii. La cronica general (thirteenth century);
iii. El Poema del Cid (twelfth century); and lastly, the ballads of
the Cid. The extract given is, however, a word for word translation
from the Cronica del Cid. The first and only edition of
this chronicle was printed in 1552, but it is impossible to ascertain
its age. (The Abbot who published it absurdly supposed it to
have been written during the Cid’s lifetime.) The incident in the
given extract seems to have much amused a mediæval audience,
and it was often enlarged and improved upon by the minstrels and
story-tellers.</p><div id="hisFocus"></div>
<p><span class="smcap">Cid, The (Arabic, Said = Lord), Don Rodrigo Diaz de Bivar</span>,
also styled <i>The Campeador</i>, the national hero of Spain, was born
at Burgos about 1040. The facts of his career have been wrapped
by his admiring countrymen in such a haze of glorifying myths, that
it is scarcely possible to detect them. His life, however, appears
to have been entirely spent in fierce warfare with the Moors, then
masters of a great part of Spain. His exploits are set forth in the
works given in the note to the Chronicle of the Cid; and the story
of his love for Ximena is the subject of Corneille’s masterpiece,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
“Le Cid” (based on a play by the Spanish dramatist Guillen de
Castro). The Campeador’s last achievement was the capture from
the Moors of Valencia, where he died in 1099.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Epigrams.</span> The names of two famous satirists, of Forner (d. 1797) and
Pitillas, are, for various reasons, lacking in this compilation.</p>

1799, and died in Madrid in 1867, is given the priority of those
authors, akin to the Periodical Essayists in English literature,
called in Spain writers of “<i>costumbres</i>” (manners and customs of
the people), who occupy so important a place in the Spanish literature
of the nineteenth century, and amongst whom de Larra
(Figaro) is pre-eminent. Unfortunately El Solitario employs such
subtle style and archaic phrases that the Spaniards themselves
complain they have to read his works with a dictionary.</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Estebanillo Gonzalez, The Life of</span>,” which appeared in 1646,
is the autobiography of a buffoon, who was long in the service of
Ottavio Piccolomini, the great general of the Thirty Years’ War,
but it is an autobiography so full of fiction, that Le Sage, sixty
years after its appearance, easily changed it into a mere romance
(Ticknor).</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Fernan Caballero</span>” (Cecilia Böhl de Faber, daughter of the
Spanish scholar), was born in 1796, and married three times.
She is sometimes known under her last name, Cecilia Arron (or
Arrom) de Azala. Her numerous works, chiefly novelas, were
published under the pseudonym of Fernan Caballero, the name
of a little village in La Mancha. They give truthful and lively
pictures of Spanish (especially Andalusian) life and manners, are
eminently national in tone and spirit, and have an excellent moral
tendency, which combination soon made her one of the most
popular Spanish writers of the nineteenth century. She also
shares with Trueba the honour of collecting Spanish Folk-tales and
popular songs from the mouths of the people, before the days of
Folk-lore societies. Queen Isabella II. made her an offer of
a residence in the Alcazar of Seville, of which she availed herself
till the revolution of 1868, after which she lived in a modest villa,
and devoted herself to charity. She died April 7, 1877.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Folk-tales.</span> To a student of Spanish Folk-lore this selection will be
unsatisfactory. The tales from Fernan Caballero and Trueba (see
<i>Biographical Notes</i>) are, however, amusing, while Southey’s verses
present a sample of the numerous tales current in Spain about the
saints, and which are more often than not allied to the ridiculous.

<p><span class="smcap">Guevara, Luis Velez de</span>, born in 1572 or 1574 at Ecija in
Andalusia. He wrote a good deal for the stage (four hundred
plays), in which he was an early follower of Lope de Vega; but
the work which established his fame was the “Diablo Cojuelo,”
the “Limping Devil,” which suggested the idea of Le Sag
famous “Diable Boiteux.” Guevara died in the year 1644.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hartzenbusch, Juan Eugenio</span>, lived from 1805 to 1880, was born
of a German father and Spanish mother. He is one of the first
scholars, prose writers, and critics of the century, and like his
contemporary, Mesonero Romanos, edited valuable collections of
the flower of the old Spanish drama. His masterpiece is the
tragedy, “The Lovers of Teruel,” which treats upon an old Spanish
legend, and is one of the most popular of modern plays. An
opera with the same title and subject, by a Spanish composer of
the day, is also deservedly popular. “Mariquita la Pelona,”
which is taken from a collection of short tales by this author, is
written in old Spanish, and has a sequel in a modern “Mariquita,”
who repairs to a convent for a year to obtain possession of a sum
of money offered her by some unknown person, on condition she
undergoes this temporary confinement, to find at the expiration of
the twelve months that the mysterious donor is a slighted suitor,
who had vowed to humiliate her.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Iglesias</span>, born in Salamanca, wrote a number of poems, the lighter of
which have alone retained popularity, the serious and duller ones,
written after he became a priest, being justly neglected. He died
in 1791.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Isla, Father</span>, was born in 1703, and died in 1781 at Bologna, where,
being a Jesuit, he had been sent on the general expulsion of his
order from Spain. He was an author possessed of a brilliant and
delicate satire, most thoroughly exemplified in his celebrated work,
“The History of the Famous Preacher, Friar Gerund,” a direct
attack on the bad style of preaching then in vogue. Padre Isla is
also prominent as the translator into Spanish of “Gil Blas,” which,
without any foundation, he maintained had been stolen by Le Sage
from Spanish literature.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Jérica (Xérica), Pablo de</span> (he was a young man during the French
revolution), is very severely criticised by Blanco García in his
“History of the Literature of the Nineteenth Century.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Larra, Mariano José de</span> (Figaro), was born in Madrid in the year
1809. Receiving his first education in France, where his father
served as doctor in Napoleon’s army, he returned to complete it at
Madrid, and afterwards repaired to the University of Valladolid,
where he began to study law. He wrote his first prose essays at
the age of twenty, but it was his later articles, signed “El pobrecito
Hablador,” which first gave him the undisputed reputation of critic
and writer of “<i>costumbres</i>,” among the host of which, his Spanish
contemporaries and imitators, he reigns supreme, while what
preserve his fame are the brilliant and satirical articles signed
“Figaro,” amongst which “The Old Castilian,” and “Yo quiero
ser comico,” are the best known. Unfortunately his private life
was disturbed by wild love affairs, and he committed suicide on
account of an attachment to a married lady, in 1837, at the age of
twenty-eight.</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Libro de los Exemplos</span>” (author unknown). This collection of tales
is considered by Don Pascual de Gayangos to be posterior to Don
Juan Manuel. The greater part of the tales are taken from Rabbi
Mosch Sefardi’s “Disciplina Clericalis” (early part of the twelfth
century), probably the Latin translation of an Arabic original,
which is drawn from Oriental sources, and is itself the common
well from which drew, amongst others, the authors of the “Gesta
Romanorum,” the “Decameron,” and the “Canterbury Tales.”
The story entitled “The Biter Bit” figures, for instance, in the
“Disciplina Clericalis” and the Gesta Romanorum. “El Libro
de los Gatos” belongs to the same century as the “Libro de
los Exemplos” (or Enxemplos).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lope Felix de Vega Carpio</span> was born on November 25, 1562, at
Madrid. This extraordinary Spanish genius, second only to
Cervantes, than whom he was more popular during the lifetime
of both, rose to a degree of fame reached by few of any country.
Epics, serious and humorous (see “<i>Gatomaquia</i>”); novelas; ballads;
epigrams; plays—religious, heroic, of intrigue, or of domestic life;
nothing, in fact, came amiss to his pen. But it is as dramatist that
he is best known, and in which quality his facility was such that at
his death it was reckoned he had composed eighteen hundred plays
and four hundred autos (religious dramas), while it is stated that
one of his plays was written and acted within five days. Lope de
Vega’s last days were the prey to a melancholy fanaticism. He
regretted he had ever been engaged in any occupations but such as
were exclusively religious; and on one occasion he went through
with a private discipline so cruel that the walls of the compartment
where it occurred were found sprinkled with his blood. From this
he never recovered, and he died on August 27, 1635, nearly seventy-three
years old. His funeral, which immense crowds thronged to
see, lasted nine days; and of the eulogies and poems written on
the occasion, those in Spanish were sufficient to form one volume,
those in Italian another.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Manuel, Prince Don Juan</span>, born May 5, 1282, at Escalona, died
1349, was of the blood royal of Castile and Leon, nephew to
Alfonso the Wise, cousin to Sancho IV. He first fought against
the Moors when he was twelve, and the rest of his years were
spent in filling great offices in the State, or in military operations
on the Moorish frontier. In spite of a life full of intrigue and
violence he devoted himself successfully to literature, and is the
first great Spanish prose writer. In “Count Lucanor,” his best
and more known work, most of the tales are of Oriental origin.
That Shakespeare knew the tale, here given the title of his play,
is indubitable; while “The Naked King” will appear familiar to
readers of Hans Andersen’s fairy tales (“The Emperor’s New
Clothes” in its turn has given the plot for Ludwig Fulda’s drama,
“The Talisman,” considered the best German play of the last
three years, and recently introduced into England by Mr.
Beerbohm Tree under the title of “Once Upon a Time”).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mendoza, Diego Hurtado de</span>, a distinguished Spanish statesman,
soldier, and historian, was born at Granada in 1503. After studying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
at the Universities of Granada and Salamanca, he entered the
service of the Emperor Charles V., and was employed in Italy
both as diplomatist and general with equal success. He at last
fell under the displeasure of Philip II. of Spain, and in 1567 was
banished. He died at Madrid in the year 1575. His greatest
work is “La guerra de Granada contra los Moriscos”; he also
wrote some fine poetry; and claims the merit of producing in
“Lazarillo de Tormes” the first model of the <i>novela picoresca</i>,
peculiar to the literature of Spain. “Lazarillo” was translated
into English as early as 1586 by David Rowland, of which rendering
as many as twenty editions are known, and which was re-edited
in the seventeenth century by James Blakeston, with but
slight alterations. Like other books enjoying a wide reputation, it
produced many imitations, among them a “Second Part” of little
merit. See <i>Book of Jokes</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mesonero Romanos, Ramon de</span> (El Curioso Parlante), born in
Madrid, 1803, died in 1882, who appeared in the literary world,
almost simultaneously, with de Larra, and together with him and
Estébanez de Calderón belongs to the writers of “<i>costumbres</i>,”
seems to an English reader inferior to these two in style and conception,
though Spaniards consider his “Escenas Matritenses” one
of the great works of the nineteenth century, and they are held
by Blanco García to be invaluable photographs of life in the
writer’s days. Mesonero Romanos was also a composer of light
and piquant verses, and distinguished himself in the critical world
by his collections of Spanish dramatists, published by Rivadeneyra.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Moratin, Leandro Fernandez</span>, died 1828, the more famous son of
a famous father (Nic. Fern. Moratin).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Newspaper Humour.</span> The strictly humorous Spanish periodical
literature of to-day is of no great merit, and often borders upon
impropriety. Of the papers from which cuttings are here given,
<i>La Ilustracion Española y Americana</i> (the Spanish <i>Illustrated
News</i>), is first-rate in its class—Fernandez Bremen is a well-known
contributor. The daily paper—<i>El Imparcial</i>—devotes a
sheet every Monday to lighter and more amusing literature under
the direction of Señor Ortega Munilla. Manuel Palacio is the
comic poet of the day. Taboada, who writes for <i>El Madrid
Comico</i>, the nearest approach to our <i>Punch</i>, is nothing if not
vulgar. <i>Blanco y Negro</i> is a fairly successful attempt of humour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
with propriety. The famous periodical, <i>El Padre Cobos</i>, is not
represented here as (it appeared in the years 1854-56) it cannot be
considered to belong to the present day. It is, moreover, purely
political.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ossorio y Bernard, Manuel</span> (nineteenth century). A humbler
member of the <i>Spectator</i> school, or “autores de costumbres.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Palacio Valdés, Armando</span> (nineteenth century). One of the
Spanish novelists of the day, and of great popularity, especially
in America, where nearly all his novels have been translated into
English. “Sister Saint Sulpice” is perhaps his masterpiece. Of
his later novels, “Froth” should be avoided as a disagreeable
work, and no true picture of aristocratic Spanish circles. “El
Maestrante,” the last work of this author, is to be brought out
shortly by Mr. Heinemann.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pardo Bazan, Emilia</span>, native of Corunna, September 16, 1851,
married in 1868, is one of the most gifted women of the times,
and in fame the Madame de Staël of Spain. She belongs to the
Naturalistic school of novelists; does not, however, lack tinges of
idealism. Her critical power is manifest in the review, <i>El Teatro
Critico</i>, for three years the product of her pen alone, and the
issuing of which, it is to be regretted, she has—owing to stress of
work—suspended for this year (1894). She is, furthermore, editor
of a series of works of special reference to women (whether of
fiction, or of scientific, historical, and philosophical interest), for
which she has already translated John Stuart Mill’s “The Subjection
of Women,” while she promises, among other volumes, a
Spanish version of “Adam Bede.” The little tale “First Love”
is given here as being suitable for this volume, rather than as
typical of Doña Emilia’s pen. Her works are too numerous to be
here recounted.</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Pedigree of Fools.</span>” This was versified at a later date.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pérez Galdos, Benito</span>, born in Las Palmas (the Canary Isles) in
1845, came to Madrid in 1863, where he took his degree in law.
His fame rests upon the “Epistodios Nacionales,” in which,
following in the steps of Erckmann-Chatrian, he illustrates his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
national history in a series of romances. The first series, to which
the volume “Gerona” belongs, covers the period from the battle
of Trafalgar to the entry of Ferdinand VII. into Spain (1814).
Unlike his French prototypes, Pérez Galdos is furnished with no
small amount of humour. In “Gerona” the grim horrors of
the siege are well contrasted by passages, such as those given,
and a third, in which the two boys Manolet and Badolet catch
rats in the cellars, in danger themselves of being devoured by the
army of famishing rodents, which are led by a huge fat rat, abused
by the boys under the name of Napoleon, and which they finally
catch and propose to sell in the market for at least ten reals (2s.)
Pérez Galdos changes his residence according to the scenes of the
subject at which he is working, and is at present at Santander.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pinedo, Luis de.</span> See <i>Book of Jokes</i>.</p>
<p>“<span class="smcap">Poema del Cid.</span>” This grand old poem, unquestionably the oldest in
the Spanish language, is by Sanchez, who first published it in
1779, given as early a date as the middle of the twelfth century,
about fifty years after the death of the Cid. Some spirited fragmentary
translations by Mr. John Hookham Frere are appended
to the early edition of Southey’s “Chronicle of the Cid,” and the
whole laid before the reader in verse and somewhat epitomised
prose by Mr. John Ormsby, whose work is invaluable to English
students of the poem, not only for its true rendering, but for
the fine introduction. An attempt at old ballad language and
style may perhaps be excused in the extract selected, by reason
that this, the most humorous incident in the poem, had unfortunately
not been put into verse by either Mr. Hookham or Mr.
Ormsby, and a fresh departure seemed desirable to avoid invidious
comparison. The passage, alas! is also considerably abridged to
suit the requirements of the present volume. For the rendering of
the old Spanish I have to thank the valuable tuition of Señor Don
José Balari y Jovany, of the University of Barcelona, to whom, as
a philologist of no small merit, attention has already been drawn
in England. The following passage is from Ford’s “Guide to
Spain”—Burgos Cathedral.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span> “In the ante-room of the chapter-house
is preserved <i>El Cofre del Cid</i>, a trunk clamped with iron,
and now attached to the north wall, which the Cid filled with
sand, and then pledged to the Jews as full of gold, for a loan
of 600 marks, which he afterwards honestly repaid.”</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Polo, Jacinto</span>, flourished in 1630, and is known as the composer of
some lyrical poetry and author of prose satires in the style of
Quevedo’s Visions. It has, however, been doubted by Gayangos
and other critics if “The University of Love and School of
Interest,” from which Ticknor gives the extract “Aunts,” was
written by Polo.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Popular Songs.</span> Long romances or ballads, like those of the olden
times, are also sung in the streets of Spain by the blind minstrels.
The so-called popular songs are, however, of the kind here given,
which bear a strong family likeness to the <i>stornelli</i> and <i>rispetti</i> of
the Italian peasantry, and which, illustrating the origin of the
word <i>ballad</i>, are danced to. The verses often embody quaint conceits.
The stones in the pavement quarrelling over which should
be trodden on by a fair maid is not very far-fetched for a Spanish
compliment. A Spanish lover will adore anything that has the
remotest connection to his lady-love, and a record “flor” (flower
= sweet saying) which hails from South America is, “Blessed be
even the razor with which your father shaves himself.” The
accompaniment to the songs is in dancing rhythm thrummed on
the ubiquitous guitar, and often marked by the castanets of the
dancers, or, in Oriental fashion, by the clapping of hands of the
bystanders. The air sung consists of three or four phrases at
most, each a combination of nasally intoned, long-sustained notes
ending in odd twists and turns.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Portuguese Epitaphs.</span> The Castilians always sharpen their wits on
the Portuguese, who, together with the Biscayans, are laughed at
for their simplicity. The Portuguese is also accused of a love of
brag. This joking is carried so far that, to take off the poor
Portuguese, anecdotes and epitaphs (as in those selected) are
written in the Portuguese language by Spaniards. The Andalusian
also plays the braggart, and is a reputed payer of fantastic and
exaggerated compliments (<i>flores</i>) to the fair sex. The Gallegan is
credited with the shrewdness of the Yorkshireman.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Proverbs.</span> Many of these “wise sayings drawn from long experience,”
to which the Spanish people are especially addicted, are given in
the English rendering of an old book on Spanish proverbs in the
library of the British Museum.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Quevedo, Francisco Gomez de</span>, the eminent Spanish satirist, was
born of a distinguished family at Madrid, 1580. He was sent early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
to the University of Alcalá, where he took his degree at the age of
fifteen. He mixed much in fashionable society, but in consequence
of a duel he was compelled to quit the court and repair to Naples,
where he was received by the Spanish envoy, the Duke of Osuna,
who not only retained him in his service, but procured his pardon
at Madrid. On the fall of his patron Quevedo returned to court;
but scarcely had he arrived there when he was arrested, and confined
for three years to his country seat, upon the charge of being
the author of certain libels against the Government. In 1641 he
was again arrested on the charge of libel, and cast into prison,
where he remained for nearly two years. He died sometime after
his release in September, 1645. Quevedo was undoubtedly one
of the best writers of his age, both in prose and verse. His
longest prose satire, “The History and Life of the Great Sharper,
Paul of Segovia,” first printed in 1626, belongs to the style of
fiction invented by Mendoza in his “Lazarillo,” and has most of
the characteristics of its class. His “Sueños,” or Visions, are
equally famous, and are extremely original. His works were
translated into English by Sir Roger L’Estrange, and passed
through about ten editions in forty years, and again by Stevens
about the close of the last century. This most original of Spanish
writers (excepting Cervantes) distinguished himself by his extraordinary
versatility of talent. His poems, collected under the title
of “El Parnaso Español,” consist of lyrical poems, satires,
burlesque pieces, and more than a thousand sonnets of remarkable
beauty.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ribot y Fontserré.</span> The tales current abroad of the eccentricities
of Englishmen are many. A Spaniard will gravely tell a tale of
how an Englishman, after a serious railway accident on the Continent,
in which his valet was killed, gathered together the fragments
of the latter’s body, packed them in the man’s trunk, and
despatched this to the family of the deceased. The tale of the
somewhat Dundrearyesque lord may, however, be based on fact,
for the story is known in England. It is here given from a
Spanish humorous publication of the first half of this century. A
veteran in journalism like Mr. Sala would probably know the
origin, and name the hero of the story.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rojas, Francisco de (Rojas y Zorrilla)</span>, flourished during the
greater part of Calderon’s life, and may have survived him. He
was born in Toledo, and in 1641 was made a Knight of the Order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
of Santiago; but when he died is not known. Unless he began
his career too early to be a mere follower, he certainly belongs to
Calderon’s school. He is perhaps most successful in tragedies, of
which the best play is “None below the King.” This work still
maintains a position on the stage, and is worth reading if only as
an example of the extraordinary sense of honour and allegiance
entertained by Spaniards in those past times.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rueda, Lope de</span>, is the author of four comedias, two pastoral colloquies
(“Timbria” is one), and minor works, all written for representation,
and which were unquestionably acted before public
audiences by the strolling company Lope de Rueda led about.
The period in which he flourished is probably between 1544 and
1567. In spite of belonging to the then despised and rejected profession
of the stage, he was interred with honour in the great
cathedral of Cordova.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Santos, Francesco</span>, a native of Madrid, died not far from the year
1700. Between 1663 and 1697 he gave to the world sixteen
volumes of different kinds of works for the popular amusement.
The oldest of the series is “Dia y Noche en Madrid,” the hero of
which, a stranger, falls into the hands of a not over-honest servant,
who undertakes to serve as guide to him in Madrid. “Truth on
the Rack; or, the Cid come to Life again,” is an allegorical work
(from it the tale “La Tarasca” is drawn), and is amusing in that
the Cid on his return to earth is much disgusted with the traditions
and ballads about himself.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Segovia, Antonio Maria</span>, who signed his articles with the pseudonym
“The Student,” has the fame of being the most classic in
style of the Spanish periodical essayists of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Selgas y Carrasco, José</span>, was born in Murcia in 1824, and died at
Madrid, 1882. He was one of the contributors to the famous
periodical <i>El Padre Cobos</i>, and exhibits an inimitable serious
humour in his volumes of “Loose Leaves” (“Hojas Sueltas”).</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Timoneda, Juan de</span>, a bookseller, one of the founders of the popular
theatre in Spain, flourished in the year 1590. He was also an
early writer of Spanish tales, his first attempt being “Patrañuelo,”
a small work which drew its material from widely different sources—some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
being found in the Gesta Romanorum, others, like the story
of Griselda, from Boccaccio, another, familiar to English readers
by the ballad of “King John and the Abbot of Canterbury,” probably
from Sacchetti. Timoneda was a friend of Lope de Rueda,
whose works he edited.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Trueba, Antonio de</span>, born Christmas, 1819 (?), of poor and respectable
parents, within the jurisdiction of the province of Biscay, was
sent, at the age of fifteen, to work in a hardware store in Madrid,
where he spent all his spare time and hours, stolen from sleep, in
reading and writing, until he began to publish, and finally dedicated
himself wholly to literature. He is the exponent of humble
Spanish life, especially of the country people, and if he is somewhat
too rose-coloured in his views, it is, perhaps, not an unpardonable
fault. His collection of popular songs was received with enthusiasm,
and though he is now out of vogue as an author, the songs and his
prose works, of which most are based upon folk-tales, will always
be of value for the researches of Folk-lore.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Valera, Juan</span>, was born in the province of Cordova on October 18,
1824. He had aristocratic connections, and was early in life
enrolled in the diplomatic service, to which he owes his great
familiarity with European literature. He subsequently entered
politics, and until the age of forty-two had been able to give up to
authorship but his hours of leisure, to which we owe his critical
studies and translations. “Pepita Jiménez,” his first novel, was
produced in 1874, and was a “success unparalleled in the history
of modern Spanish literature.” To continue in the words of Mr.
Edmund Gosse:—“This book still remains, after the large development
of fiction in Spain, the principal, the typical Spanish
novel of our days.... It has become a classic in the lifetime of
its author, and is studied, imitated, analysed as a book which has
passed beyond all danger of the vicissitudes of fashion, and which
will unquestionably survive as one of the glories of the national
literature.... ‘Pepita Jiménez’ is Spain itself in a microcosm—Spain
with its fervour, its sensual piety, its rhetoric and hyperbole,
its superficial passion, its mysticism, its graceful extravagance.”
Later novels are “El Comendador Mendoza,” “Doña Luz,” and
“Doctor Faustino.” Valera occupies a pre-eminent position as
politician, journalist, author, and critic, and is at present at Vienna
as Spanish ambassador to the Austrian Court.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Vicente, Gil</span>, a Portuguese, but who ranks among Spanish dramatists,
as he wrote ten plays in Castilian. (It was a not uncommon
practice for Portuguese authors to employ Castilian. Saa de
Miranda, the pastoral poet and contemporary of Gil Vicente,
wrote six of his eight eclogues in the more sonorous Castilian.)
Gil Vicente flourished as a writer for the stage from 1506 to 1536;
died in 1557.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Yriarte (Iriarte), Tomas de</span>, born on the island of Tenerife in
1750, but educated mostly at Madrid, owes his reputation chiefly
to his literary fables, the influence of which was much needed in
the age of bad writing in which they appeared, and in which he
showed originality by adapting the attributes of animals to only
one class of men, namely, authors, and not mankind at large, as
had always been done before. Yriarte died in 1791.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Zayas y Sotomayor, Maria de.</span> The only information we can
gather respecting this lady is founded on the authority of the
industrious bibliographer, Nicolas Antonio, who assures us that
she was a native of Madrid, and that she composed two series of
novels, under the titles of “Novelas Amorosas i exemplares,” and
“Novelas i Seraos.” She is also mentioned by Lope de Vega in
his “Laurel de Apolo” in very flattering terms. The style and
character of this write novels exhibit much of the ease and
elegance, with no little of the freedom, of Boccaccio; they abound
with incident, both humorous and tragic, and with chivalric or
amorous adventure. With little artifice, however, in the plot, and
less study of character, there are some striking and effective scenes;
while the situations are often well conceived, and the suspense is
maintained throughout so as to please or surprise us. “The Miser
Chastised” is perhaps the only one of her novels in which the
writer wholly adopts a comic tone and spirit, without any touches
of a more sentimental kind. With some humour, this story combines
considerable ease and originality. Under the same title as
the foregoing appeared a drama from the pen of Don Juan de la
Hoz Mota, a Spanish dramatic writer of some celebrity, who succeeded
in exposing the vice of avarice on the stage in strong and
natural colours, and with such bold and happy strokes of ridicule,
as almost to merit its being placed in the same rank with the
famous “Avare” of Molière (Thomas Roscoe). Doña Maria de
Zayas, flourished in the year 1637.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
<span class="smcap">Zorrilla, José</span>, born at Valladolid, February 21, 1817, poet <i>par
excellence</i> of traditionary and legendary subjects, has for years been
prime favourite of the Spanish people, and his inexhaustible vein
of poetry showed but scanty signs of diminishing even in the last
years of a hoary old age. His most popular work, “Don Juan
Tenorio” (1844), a drama in verse treating of the notorious Don
Juan, hero of Tirso de Molina’s “Seville Deceiver,” of Byron’s
poem, and Mozart’s opera, is a masterpiece of harmonious and flowing
verse, and of fine dramatic effect. It is played annually in every
town where there is a theatre throughout all Spain on the eve of
All Saints’ Day, when the scene in which the bodies rise from their
graves and come to the banquet of Don Juan and his boon companions
upon the former’s blasphemous invitation is awaited with
breathless horror by crowded houses. Other long poems are the
“Legend of the Cid,” and “The Cobbler and the King.” Zorrilla
died the 23rd of January, 1893.</p>

too terrible.... Yet we must return to Ibsen, with his remorseless surgery,
his remorseless electric-light, until we, too, have grown strong and learned to

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
