        Hypertext fiction is a genre of digital literature which is 
        made up of non sequential and interlinking lexia. It operates
         within the postmodern context through its adherence to several 
         key aspects of the literary genre. There is a shared authorship between 
         reader and writer, made possible by the multiple pathways of the hypertext 
         links. The multiple pathways render linear notions of narrative impossible.

   HYPER-TEXT-FICTION is a type of digital literature that uses hyperlinks to create non-linear texts. In my case the literature is based on the top 50 eBooks from the Gutenberg project. Every time the web page<a href="./index.html">(TEXT)</a> is opened, a piece of text made up out of 6 separated oeuvres is created.
